Feature: Cloning a Git repository
  As a Tails user
  when I clone a Git repository
  all Internet traffic should flow only through Tor

  Background:
    Given a computer
    And I capture all network traffic
    And I start the computer
    And the computer boots Tails
    And I log in to a new session
    And GNOME has started
    And Tor is ready
    And available upgrades have been checked
    And all notifications have disappeared
    And I save the state so the background can be restored next scenario

  Scenario: Cloning a Git repository anonymously over HTTPS
    When I run "git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/myprivatekeyispublic/testing" in GNOME Terminal
    Then process "git" is running within 10 seconds
    And process "git" has stopped running after at most 180 seconds
    And the Git repository "testing" has been cloned successfully
    And all Internet traffic has only flowed through Tor
