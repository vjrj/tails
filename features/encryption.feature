Feature: Encryption and verification using GnuPG
  As a Tails user
  I want to be able to easily encrypt and sign messages using GnuPG
  And decrypt and verify GnuPG blocks

  Background:
    Given a computer
    And the network is unplugged
    And I start the computer
    And the computer boots Tails
    And I log in to a new session
    And GNOME has started
    And all notifications have disappeared
    And I generate an OpenPGP key named "test" with password "asdf"
    And I save the state so the background can be restored next scenario

  Scenario: Encryption and decryption using Tails OpenPGP Applet
    When I type a message into gedit
    And I encrypt the message using my OpenPGP key
    Then I can decrypt the encrypted message

  Scenario: Signing and verification using Tails OpenPGP Applet
    When I type a message into gedit
    And I sign the message using my OpenPGP key
    Then I can verify the message's signature

  Scenario: Encryption/signing and decryption/verification using Tails OpenPGP Applet
    When I type a message into gedit
    And I both encrypt and sign the message using my OpenPGP key
    Then I can decrypt and verify the encrypted message

  Scenario: Symmetric encryption and decryption using Tails OpenPGP Applet
    When I type a message into gedit
    And I symmetrically encrypt the message with password "asdf"
    Then I can decrypt the encrypted message
