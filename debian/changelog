tails (1.1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Dummy entry for next release.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Wed, 23 Jul 2014 00:49:19 +0200

tails (1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rebase on Debian Wheezy
    - Upgrade literally thousands of packages.
    - Migrate to GNOME3 fallback mode.
    - Install LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice.
    - Remove custom LSB logging: Wheezy has fancy colored init
      logging.

  * Major new features
    - UEFI boot support.
    - Replace the Windows XP camouflage with an experimental Windows 8
      camouflage.
    - Install Linux 3.14.12-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Bring back VirtualBox guest modules, installed from Wheezy
      backports. Full functionality is only available when using the
      32-bit kernel.

  * Security fixes
    - Fix write access to boot medium via udisks (#6172).
    - Don't allow the desktop user to pass arguments to
      tails-upgrade-frontend (Closes: #7410).
    - Make persistent file permissions safer (Closes #7443):
      * Make the content of /etc/skel non-world-readable. Otherwise,
        such files may be copied to /home/amnesia, and in turn to the
        persistent volume, with unsafe permissions. That's no big deal
        in /home/amnesia (that is itself not world-readable), *but*
        the root of the persistent volume has to be world-readable.
      * Have activate_custom_mounts create new directories with safe
        permissions.
      * Set strict permissions on /home/amnesia (Closes: #7463).
      * Fix permissions on persistent directories that were created
        with unsafe permissions (Closes: #7458).
      * Fix files ownership while copying persistence (Closes: #7216).
        The previous instructions to copy the persistent data were
        creating personal files that belong to root. I don't think
        there is a way of preserving the original ownership using
        Nautilus (unless doing a "move" instead of a "copy" but that's
        not what we are trying to do here).
    - Disable FoxyProxy's proxy:// protocol handler (Closes: #7479).
      FoxyProxy adds the proxy:// protocol handler, which can be used
      to configure the proxy via an URI. A malicious web page can
      include (or a malicious exit node can inject) some JavaScript
      code to visit such an URI and disable or otherwise change
      Iceweasel's proxy settings. While using this to disable
      proxying will be dealt with safely by our firewall, this could
      be used to defeat stream isolation, although the user must be
      tricked into accepting the new proxy settings.
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.7.0esr-0+tails1~bpo70+1
      (Firefox 24.7.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    - Upgrade to Linux 3.14.12-1 (fixes CVE-2014-4699).
    - Upgrade libav-based packages to 0.8.13-1 (fixes CVE-2014-4609).
    - Upgrade to libxml2 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy1 (fixes CVE-2014-0191).
    - Upgrade to dbus 1.6.8-1+deb7u3 (fixes CVE-2014-3477,
      CVE-2014-3532 and CVE-2014-3533).

  * Bugfixes
    - Disable GNOME keyring's GnuPG functionality. (Closes: #7330) In
      feature/regular-gnupg-agent, we installed the regular GnuPG
      agent so that it is used instead of GNOME keyring's one. This is
      not enough on Wheezy, so let's disable the starting of the "gpg"
      component of GNOME keyring.
    - Make sure /etc/default/locale exists, with a sensible default
      value (Closes: #7333). Before Tails Greeter's PostLogin script
      are run, /etc/default/locale does not exist on Wheezy. Our
      tails-kexec initscript (and quite a few other scripts we run)
      depends on this file to exist. So, let's make sure it exists,
      with a sensible default value.
    - Create the tails-persistence-setup user with the same UID/GID it
      had on Tails/Squeeze. (Closes: #7343) Else, our various checks
      for safe access rights on persistence.conf fail.
    - Revert back to browsing the offline documentation using Iceweasel
      instead of Yelp (Closes: #7390, #7285).
    - Make the new NetworkManager configuration directory persistent,
      when the old one was, but disable the old one (Closes: #7338).
    - Before running tails-upgrade-frontend, chdir to a world-readable
      place (Closes: #7641). In particular, Archive::Tar::Wrapper,
      when called by tails-install-iuk, wants to chdir back to the
      original cwd after it has chdir'd elsewhere to do its job.

  * Minor improvements
    - Install seahorse-nautilus, replacing seahorse-plugins (Closes #5516).
    - Install hledger (custom backport, for now): our accountants need this.
    - Install stable Scribus instead of scribus-ng.
    - Install the printer driver for Epson Inkjet that use ESC/P-R.
    - Install the BookletImposer PDF imposition toolkit. It's tiny,
      and really helpful e.g. when producing booklets.
    - Install gtkhash and nautilus-gtkhash (Closes #6763).
    - Import new version of Tor Launcher:
      · Now based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.4.
      · Tor bug #11772: Proxy Type menu not set correctly
      · Tor bug #11699: Change &amp;#160 to &#160; in network-settings.dtd
      · Correctly handle startup paths that contain dot.
    - Upgrade to Torbutton 1.6.9.0.
    - Avoid shipping python2.6 in addition to python2.7.
    - Don't install Gobby 0.4 anymore. Gobby 0.5 has been available in
      Debian since Squeeze, now is a good time to drop the obsolete
      0.4 implementation.
    - Require a bit less free memory before checking for upgrades with
      Tails Upgrader. The general goal is to avoid displaying "Not
      enough memory available to check for upgrades" too often due to
      over-cautious memory requirements checked in the wrapper.
    - Make Tails Greeter's help window resolution-aware. Previously it
      used a static 800x600 which was problematic on lower resolutions,
      and sub-optimal on higher resolutions. Now it adapts itself
      according to the screen resolution.
    - Whisperback now sanitizes attached logs better with respect to
      DMI data, IPv6 addresses, and serial numbers (Closes #6797,
      #6798, #6804).
    - Integrate the new logo in Tails Installer (Closes #7095)
    - Also install linux-base and linux-compiler-gcc-4.8-x86 from
      sid. This way, we can get rid of our linux-compiler-gcc-4.8-x86
      3.12, and it makes things a bit more consistent.
    - Include the syslinux binary, and its MBR, in the ISO filesystem.
      This in turn allows Tails Installer to use this binary and MBR,
      which is critical for avoiding problems (such as #7345) on
      "Upgrade from ISO".
    - Include syslinux.exe for win32 in utils/win32/ on the ISO
      filesystem (Closes: #7425).
    - Tails Installer:
      * Add consistent margins in GUI.
      * Always reset the target drive's MBR, without asking for
        confirmation, after installing or upgrading.
      * Install the bootloader using the syslinux binary found on the
        target device, once the Live OS has been extracted/copied
        there.
    - Enable double-clicking to pick entries in the language or
      keyboard layout lists in Tails Greeter.
    - Install backport of shared-mime-info 1.3 (Closes: #7079).
    - Make sanity-check prompts closable in Tails Persistence Setup
      (Closes: #7119).
    - Fix quick search in Tails Greeter's Other languages window
      (Closes: #5387).
    - Install systemd. It is not enabled by default, but having it
      around will help doing the migration work.
    - Enable AppArmor on the kernel command-line. This is a no-op
      without the userspace tools and with no profile shipped, but it
      will make it easier to fix this part of the situation.

  * Build system
    - Bump Vagrant builder's memory for RAM builds. Wheezy requires
      more space to build, and the resulting image is larger.
    - Fix Vagrant compatibility issue. Some classes' methods/fields
      have been renamed between Vagrant versions, so we need a simple
      compatibility layer to support all versions. Without this, it's
      not possible to issue e.g. a `build` command to an already
      running (i.e. `vm:up`:ed) Vagrant instance.
    - Move cpu and mem checks to the `build` task. Previously, when
      they were checked in `vm:up` *only* when issued while the VM
      already is up, so these checks weren't run if one issues a
      `build` when the VM is off. Now we'll fail earlier with a more
      informative error message, and it looks like a more logical home
      for them too.
    - Fix buggy memory checks for RAM building. We have to take into
      account which state the Vagrant VM is in for determining *where*
      we check if enough memory is available for a RAM build. If it's
      off, we check the host; if it's on we check the VM. Previously
      we always checked the host, which doesn't make sense when the VM
      is already started.

  * Automated test suite
    - Bump the tester VM's RAM by 256 MiB. There is not enough free
      RAM to run Tails Upgrader with just 1 GiB of RAM after the
      migration to Wheezy.
    - Always adjust OOM and memory overcommit settings. The kernel
      freezes seem to also happen for the amd64 kernel when filling
      the memory.
    - Add option to make Sikuli rety on FindFailed. This makes it
      possible to update manu images for Sikuli in just *one* test
      suite run, by continuously updating outdated pictures as we go.
    - Actually run "Upgrade from ISO" from a USB drive running the old
      version. That's what users do, and is buggy.
    - Automatically test persistent directories permissions (Closes: #7560).
    - Use read-write persistence when testing upgraded USB
      installations.  Otherwise e.g. the permission fixes won't get
      applied, and the subsequent steps testing the permissions will
      fail.
    - Actually check that the ISO's Tails is installed. The step
      "Tails is installed on USB drive $TARGET" only checks that the
      *running* Tails is installed on $TARGET, which obviously fails
      when doing an upgrade from ISO running an old Tails. That it
      worked for the same scenario running the current Tails is just
      coincidental.
    - Use OpenJDK 7 to run our test suite (Closes #7175).
    - Use qemu-system-x86_64 directly, instead of kvm, for running the
      automated test suite (Closes: #7605).

tails (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.6.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1
      (Firefox 24.6.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
      Also import the Tor Browser profile at commit
      90ba8fbaf6f23494f1a0e38d63153b3b7e65d3d3 from
      ttp/tor-browser-24.6.0esr-3.x-1.
    - Install Linux 3.14 from Debian unstable (fixes CVE-2014-3153 and
      others).
    - Install openssl from Squeeze LTS (fixes CVE-2014-0076,
      CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-0221, CVE-2014-3470 and CVE-2014-0224).
    - Install GnuTLS from Squeeze LTS (fixes CVE-2014-3466.).

  * Minor improvements
    - Add Squeeze LTS APT sources. It has been given a low pinning
      priority so explicit pinning must be used to actually install
      anything from it.
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.22-1~d60.squeeze+1.
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.13-1~deb6u+1.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 08 Jun 2014 19:14:00 +0200

tails (1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.5.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1
      (Firefox 24.5.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1+tails1~d60.squeeze+1:
      * Based on 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.
      * Backport the fix for Tor bug #11464. It adds client-side blacklists for
        all Tor directory authority keys that was vulnerable to Heartbleed.
        This protects clients in case attackers were able to compromise a
        majority of the authority signing and identity keys.

   * Bugfixes
    - Disable inbound I2P connections. Tails already restricts incoming
      connections, but this change tells I2P about it.
    - Fix link to the system requirements documentation page in the Tails
      Upgrader error shown when too little RAM is available.

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.12-2~deb6u+1.
    - Import TorBrowser profile. This was forgotten in Tails 0.23 and even
      though we didn't explicitly set those preferences in that release
      they defaulted to the same values. This future-proofs us in case the
      defaults would ever change.
    - Import new custom version of tor-launcher:
      * Based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.3.
      * Improve how Tor Launcher handles incomplete translation.
        (Tor bug #11483; more future-proof fix for Tails bug #6885)
      * Remove the bridge settings prompt. (Tor bug #11482; closes Tails
        bug #6934,)
      * Always show bridge help button. (Tor bug #11484)
    - Integrate the new Tails logo into various places:
      * The website
      * The boot splash
      * The "About Tails" dialog

  * Build system
    - Use the stable APT suite when building from the stable Git branch
      (Closes: #7022).

  * Test suite
    - Add test for the #7022 fix.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 27 Apr 2014 19:34:01 +0200

tails (0.23) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1
      (Firefox 24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).

  * Major new features
    - Spoof the network interfaces' MAC address by default (Closes: #5421),
      as designed on https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/.
    - Rework the way to configure how Tor connects to the network
      (bridges, proxy, fascist firewall): add an option to Tails Greeter,
      start Tor Launcher when needed (Closes: #5920, #5343).

  * Bugfixes
    - Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled
      (Closes: #6440).
    - Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced
      in the 2.10.8 security update (Closes: #6661).
    - Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time,
      before checking for upgrades (Closes: #6728) and unfixed known
      security issues.
    - Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver (Closes: #6460).
      We don't need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs
      on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down
    - Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available
      in Windows Camouflage mode (Closes: #5374, #6767).
    - Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin (Closes: #6807).

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.
    - Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.
    - Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one (Closes: #5456).
      This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.
    - Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).
    - Disable the autologin text consoles (Closes: #5588). This was one of
      the blockers before a screen saver can be installed
      in a meaningful way (#5684).
    - Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy,
      the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have
      to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.
    - Make it possible to manually start IBus.
    - Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser,
      using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving
      full control over Tor to the desktop user (Closes: #6383).
    - Incremental upgrades improvements:
      · Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion
        (Closes: #6513).
      · Lock down sudo credentials a bit.
      · Hide debugging information (Closes: #6505).
      · Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports.
        This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.
      · Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done
        (Closes: #6575).
      · Various user interface and phrasing improvements.
    - Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension (Closes: #6790).
    - Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange (Closes: #6632).
    - Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently,
      too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making
      it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support
      nightmare (Closes: #6679).
    - Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig (Closes: #6474).
    - Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get
      the certificate authorities added by Debian back (Closes: #6704).
    - Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.
    - Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.
    - Persistent Volume Assistant:
      · Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.
      · Optimize window height (Closes: #5458).
      · Display device paths in a more user-friendly way (Closes: #5311).

  * Build system
    - Ease updating POT and PO files at release time, and importing translations
      from Transifex (Closes: #6288, #6207).
    - Drop custom poedit backport, install it from squeeze-backports-sloppy.
    - Make ISO and IUK smaller (Closes: #6390, #6425):
      · Exclude more files from being included in the ISO.
      · Remove *.pyc later so that they are not recreated.
      · Truncate log files later so that they are not filled again.
      · At ISO build time, set mtime to the epoch for large files whose content
        generally does not change between releases. This forces rsync
        to compare the actual content of these files, when preparing an IUK,
        instead of blindly adding it to the IUK merely because the mtime
        has changed, while the content is the same.
    - Make local hooks logging consistent.

  * Test suite
    - Migrate from JRuby to native Ruby + rjb.
    - The test suite can now be run on Debian Wheezy + backports.
    - Fix buggy "persistence is not enabled" step (Closes: #5465).
    - Use IPv6 private address as of RFC 4193 for the test suite's virtual
      network. Otherwise dnsmasq from Wheezy complains, as it is not capable
      of handling public IPv6 addresses.
    - Delete volumes after each scenario unless tagged @keep_volumes.
    - Add an anti-test to make sure the memory erasure test works fine.
    - A *lot* of bugfixes, simplifications and robustness improvements.

tails (0.22.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.3.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+2
      (Firefox 24.3.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    - Upgrade NSS to 3.14.5-1~bpo60+1.
    - Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.8.
    - Workaround browser size fingerprinting issue by using small icons
      in the web browser's navigation toolbar (Closes: #6377).
      We're actually hit by Tor#9268, and this is the best workaround gk
      and I were able to find when discussing this on Tor#10095.

  * Major new features
    - Check for upgrades availability using Tails Upgrader, and propose
      to apply an incremental upgrade whenever possible (Closes: #6014).
      · Run tails-update-frontend at session login time.
      · Have tails-security-check only report unfixed security issues.
      · Greatly improve the Tails Upgrader UI and strings phrasing.
      · Enable startup notification for Tails Upgrader.
    - Install Linux 3.12 (3.12.6-2) from Debian testing. Unfortunately,
      this breaks the memory wipe feature on some hardware (#6460), but
      it fixes quite a few security issues, and improves hardware support.
    - Update the build system to be compatible with Vagrant 1.2 and 1.3,
      in addition to the already supported versions (Closes: #6221).
      Thanks to David Isaac Wolinsky <isaac.wolinsky@gmail.com>.

  * Bugfixes
    - Do not start IBus for languages that don't need it. This fixes
      the keybindings problems introduced in 0.22 (Closes: #6478).
      Thanks to WinterFairy.
    - Disable network.proxy.socks_remote_dns in the Unsafe Browser.
      Bugfix against 0.22 (Closes: #6479).
    - Fetch Tor Browser User-Agent from its own prefs, rather than from
      the obsolete Torbutton ones. Bugfix against 0.22 (Closes: #6477).
    - Upgrade Vagrant basebox to include up-to-date Debian archive keys
      (Closes: #6515, #6527).
    - Do not use a non-working proxy for downloading the Vagrant basebox
      (Closes: #6514).
    - Use IE's icon in Windows camouflage mode.
      Bugfix against 0.22 (Closes: #6536).
    - Support "upgrading" a partial Tails installation (Closes: #6438)
      and fix missing confirmation dialog in Tails Installer (Closes: #6437).
      Thanks to Andres Gomez Ramirez <andres.gomez@cern.ch>.
    - Fix browser homepage in Spanish locales (Closes: #6612).

  * Minor improvements
    - Tor 0.2.4 is stable! Adapt APT sources accordingly.
    - Update Tor Browser to 24.2.0esr-1+tails1, that uses its own NSS
      library instead of the system one.
    - Update Torbutton to 1.6.5.3.
    - Do not start Tor Browser automatically, but notify when Tor is ready.
      Warn the user when they attempt to start Tor Browser before Tor is ready.
    - Import Tor Browser profile at
      3ed5d9511e783deb86835803a6f40e7d5a182a12 from ttp/tor-browser-24.2.0esr-1.
    - Use http.debian.net for Vagrant builds, instead of the mostly broken
      (and soon obsolete) cdn.debian.net.
    - Phrasing and UI improvements in tails-upgrade-frontend.
    - Style and robustness improvements in tails-security-check.
    - Make room for upcoming UEFI support in Tails Installer.

  [Tails developers]
  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade to Iceweasel 24.2.0esr that fixes a few serious security issues.
    - Stop migrating persistence configuration and access rights. Instead,
      disable all persistence configuration files if the mountpoint has wrong
      access rights (Closes: #6413).
    - Upgrade to NSS 3.15.3 that fixes a few serious security issues affecting
      the browser, such as CVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5605 and CVE-2013-5606.

  * Major improvements
    - Switch to Iceweasel 24 (Closes: #6370).
      · Resync' (most) Iceweasel prefs with TBB 3.0-beta-1 and get rid
        of many obsolete or default settings.
      · Disable WebRTC (Closes: #6468).
      · Import TorBrowser profile at commit
        51bf06502c46ee6c1f587459e8370aef11a3422d from the tor-browser-24.2.0esr-1
        branch at https://git.torproject.org/tor-browser.git.
    - Switch to Torbutton 1.6.5 (Closes: #6371).
      · Prevent Torbutton from asking users to "upgrade TBB".
      · Use the same Tor SOCKS port as the TBB (9151) for our web browser.
        This should be enough to avoid being affected by Tor#8511.
      · Disable Torbutton 1.6's check for Tor.
        Unfortunately, the new check.torproject.org breaks the remote Tor
        check. We cannot use the local Tor check with the control port. So,
        the shortest and sanest path to fixing the check issue, because the
        remote Tor check is broken" seems to simply disable this check.
        Patch submitted upstream as Tor#10216.
    - Prepare incremental upgrades to be the next default way to upgrade Tails,
      on point-releases at least.

  * Bugfixes
    - Deny X authentication only after Vidalia exits (Closes: #6389).
    - Disable DPMS screen blanking (Closes: #5617).
    - Fix checking of the persistent volume's ACL.
    - Sanitize more IP and MAC addresses in bug reports (Closes: #6391).
    - Do not fail USB upgrade when the "tmp" directory exists on the
      destination device.
    - Tails Installer: list devices with isohybrid Tails installed
      (Closes: #6462).

  * Minor improvements
    - Create a configuration file for additional software if needed
      (Closes: #6436).
    - Translations all over the place.
    - Enable favicons in Iceweasel.
    - Do not propose to make permanent NoScript exceptions.
      In Tails, every such thing is temporary, so better only display the menu
      entry that's about temporarily allowing something.
    - Clearer warning when deleting persistent volume (thanks to Andres Gomez
      Ramirez <andres.gomez@cern.ch> for the patch).
    - Make wording in Tails Installer more consistent.

  [ WinterFairy ]
  * Use IBus instead of SCIM (Closes: #5624, #6206).
    It makes it possible to input passwords in pinentry for at least Japanese,
    Chinese and Korean languages.
  * Add an import-translation script.
    This automates the importation process of completed translations
    from Transifex.
  * Always list optimal keyboard layout in the greeter (Closes: #5741).
  * Fix on-the-fly translation of the greeter in various languages
    (Closes: #5469).

  [ Kytv]
  * Update I2P to 0.9.8.1 (Closes: #6080, #5889).
  * Improve I2P configuration:
    - Disable IPv6 support in a nicer way.
    - Disable i2cp (allows java clients to communicate from outside the JVM). If
      this is unset an exception for port 7654 would need to be added to ferm.
    - Disable "in-network" updates (this is also done in the regular I2P
      packages).
    - Disable the outproxies. Access to the Internet is already routed through
      Tor so these are unnecessary. If end-users have a good reason to go
      through one of the I2P outproxies they can turn them back on.
  * Add a couple of default I2P IRC channels to Pidgin.
  * Allow access to the local 'eepsite' through FoxyProxy.
  * Add firewall exceptions for the standard I2P ports.

  * Security fixes
    - Don't grant access to the Tor control port for the desktop user
      (amnesia). Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user
      could obtain the public IP with a get_info command.
      · Vidalia is now run as a dedicated user.
      · Remove the amnesia user from the debian-tor group.
      · Remove the Vidalia launcher in the Applications menu.
        The Vidalia instance it starts is useless, since it can't connect
        to the Tor control port.
    - Don't allow the desktop user to directly change persistence settings.
      Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user could
      leverage this feature to gain persistent root access, as long as
      persistence is enabled.
      · Fully rework the persistent filesystem and files ownership
        and permissions.
      · Run the Persistent Volume Assistant as a dedicated user, that is
        granted the relevant udisks and filesystem -level credentials.
      · At persistence activation time, don't trust existing persistence
        configuration files, migrate to the new ownership and permissions,
        migrate every known-safe existing settings and backup what's left.
        Warn the user when not all persistence settings could be migrated.
      · Persistent Volume Assistant uses the new ownership and permissions
        scheme when initializing a new persistent volume, and refuses to
        read persistence.conf if it, or the parent directory, hasn't the
        expected permissions.
      · Make boot medium 'system internal' for udisks with bilibop.
        Once Tails is based on Wheezy, this will further complete the
        protection (see #6172 for details).
    - Update Iceweasel to 17.0.10esr-0+tails2~bpo60+1.
    - Update Torbutton to 1.5.2-2, including a patch cherry-picked from
      upstream to make window resizing closer to what the design says.

  * Major new features
    - Add a persistence preset for printing settings (Closes: #5686).
      Reload CUPS configuration after persistence activation.
    - Support SD card connected through a SDIO host adapter (Closes: #6324).
      · Rebrand Tails USB installer to Tails installer.
      · Display devices brand, model and size in the Installer
        (Closes: #6292).
      · Ask for confirmation before installing Tails onto a device
        (Closes: #6293).
      · Add support for SDIO and MMC block devices to the Tails Installer
        (Closes: #5744) and the Persistent Volume Assistant (Closes: #6325).
      · Arm the udev watchdog when booted from SD (plugged in SDIO) too
        (Closes: #6327).

  * Minor improvements
    - Provide a consistent path to the persistent volume mountpoint
      (Closes: #5854).
    - Add a KeePassX launcher to the top GNOME panel (Closes: #6290).
    - Rework bug reporting workflow: point the desktop launcher to
      the troubleshooting page.
    - Make /home world-readable at build time, regardless of the Git
      working copy permissions. This makes the build process more robust
      against strict umasks.
    - Add signing capabilities to the tails-build script (Closes: #6267).
      This is in turn used to sign ISO images built by our Jenkins setup
      (Closes: #6193).
    - Simplify the ikiwiki setup and make more pages translatable.
    - Exclude the version string in GnuPG's ASCII armored output.
    - Prefer stronger ciphers (AES256,AES192,AES,CAST5) when encrypting
      data with GnuPG.
    - Use the same custom Startpage search URL than the TBB.
      This apparently disables the new broken "family" filter.
    - Update AdBlock Plus patterns.
    - Install Linux from Debian testing.
      (That is, the same version that was shipped in 0.20.1.)

  * Test suite
    - Look for "/tmp/.X11-unix/X${1#:}" too when detecting displays in use.
    - Adapt tests to match the Control Port access security fix:
      · Take into account that the amnesia user isn't part of the debian-tor
        group anymore.
      · Run as root the checks to see if a process is running: this
        is required to see other users' processes.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sat, 26 Oct 2013 23:42:46 +0200

tails (0.20.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Install Tor 0.2.4.17-rc-1~d60.squeeze+1 from the Tor project's repository.
  - Install Iceweasel 17.0.9esr with Torbrowser patches.
  - Install Linux kernel 3.10-3 (version 3.10.11-1) from sid.

  * Bugfixes
  - Remount persistence devices read-only at shutdown/reboot time
    (Closes: #6228).
  - Greeter: display a warning icon on admin password mismatch and on
    persistence unlocking failure. Thanks to Andres Gomez Ramirez
    <andres.gomez@cern.ch> for the fix!
  - Don't torsocksify Pidgin.
    Instead we disable Pidgin's GNOME integration to get the "Global proxy
    configuration", which we set to use Tor. This fixes the I2P IRC account.
  - Additional software: fix typo in notification.
  - Allow installing "Priority: standard" packages that we do not install
    by default: remove them late in the build process instead of assigning
    them a -1 APT pinning level.

  * Minor improvements
  - Update AdBlock Plus patterns.
  - Use more unique ISO file name when building from Jenkins.
  - Additional software: point to the system log on upgrade failure.
  - Set SOCKS5_USER and SOCKS5_PASSWORD in the connect-socks wrapper (used
    by Git). Else, Tor 0.2.4's IsolateSOCKSAuth and connect-proxy
    sometimes play together in some way that makes connect-proxy ask for
    a password to connect to the SocksPort. SOCKS5_USER and
    SOCKS5_PASSWORD are passed through unchanged if they were manually set
    by the user already.
  - Use our custom connect-socks wrapper for SSH. Else, Tor 0.2.4's
    IsolateSOCKSAuth and connect-proxy sometimes play together in some way
    that makes connect-proxy ask for a password to connect to the
    SocksPort. Note that connect-socks uses the default SocksPort too, so
    no change here wrt. our connection isolation design.

  * Localization
  - Import new translations from Transifex.

  * Test suite
  - Fix old ISO checking for consistent error reporting.
  - Remove custom persistence test from manual test suite.
    It was removed for the GUI in t-p-s 0.33.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 15 Sep 2013 15:49:36 +0200

tails (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Install Linux kernel 3.10.3-1 from Debian unstable.
  - Iceweasel 17.0.8esr + Torbrowser patches.

  * Bugfixes
  - Prevent Iceweasel from displaying a warning when leaving HTTPS web sites.
  - Make Iceweasel use the correct, localized search engine.
  - Fix Git access to https:// repositories.

  * Minor improvements
  - Install Dasher, a predictive text entry tool.
  - Add a wrapper around TrueCrypt which displays a warning about it soon
    being deprecated in Tails.
  - Remove Pidgin libraries for all protocols but IRC and Jabber/XMPP.
    Many of the other protocols Pidgin support are broken in Tails and
    haven't got any security auditting.
  - Disable the pre-defined Pidgin accounts so they do not auto-connect
    on Pidgin start.
  - Include information about Alsa in WhisperBack reports.
  - Explicitly restrict access to ptrace. While this setting was enabled
    by default in Debian's Linux 3.9.6-1, it will later disabled in 3.9.7-1.
    It's unclear what will happen next, so let's explicitly enable it ourselves.
  - Do not display dialog when a message is sent in Claws Mail.
  - Sync iceweasel preferences with the Torbrowser's.

  * Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.
  - Merge all Tails-related POT files into one, and make use of intltoolize
    for better integration with Transifex.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Tue, 30 Jul 2013 14:19:57 +0200

tails (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Install Linux kernel 3.9.5-1 from Debian unstable.
    Features of particular interest for Tails are the Yama LSM
    (ptrace scope restrictions) and improved hardware support.
    As a corollary, install initramfs-tools from there too.
  - Iceweasel 17.0.7esr + Torbrowser patches.
  - Unblock Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WWAN and WiMAX; block every other type of
    wireless device. Next steps are described on the
    todo/protect_against_external_bus_memory_forensics ticket.

  * Bugfixes
  - Fix write access to boot medium at the block device level,
    by installing bilibop-udev. Thanks to quidame for his support.
  - tails-greeter l10n-related fixes, thanks to winterfairy:
    · Fix so translations is applied on password mismatch messages.
    · Separate forward and login buttons and make them translatable.
  - Fix link to documentation when no sudo password is set.
  - gpgApplet: partial fix for clipboard emptying after a wrong passphrase
    was entered.
  - Workaround aufs bug in Unsafe Browser script.

  * Minor improvements
  - Drop GNOME proxy settings: we did not find any use of it we were keen
    to support, other than two programs (Seahorse, Pidgin) that are now run
    with torsocks.
  - Format newly created persistent volumes as ext4.
  - GnuPG: don't connect to the keyserver specified by the key owner.
    This feature opens the door to a variety of subtle attacks.
  - GnuPG: locate keys only from local keyrings.
    This is probably the default, but better safe than sorry.
  - Install virt-what from Wheezy.
    The version from Squeeze does not detect at least Parallels for Mac v.8.
  - Upgrade live-boot and live-config to the 3.0.x final version from Wheezy.
    · Remove /live and /lib/live/image compatibility symlinks.
    · Add /live/overlay -> /lib/live/mount/overlay symlink.
      The live-boot changes (commit d2b2a461) brought to fix Debian bug
      #696495 revert some of our previous changes (commit 77dab1cb), and as
      a result, at the time live-persist runs, no tmpfs is mounted on
      /live/overlay, which breaks the aufs mount. So, let's just ensure
      /live/overlay points to a tmpfs.
    · Really disable policykit and sudo live-config hooks.
      ... by making it believe they've already been run.
      This workarounds new live-config's default behavior.

  * Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.

  * Test suite
  - Re-enable previously disabled boot device permissions test.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Wed, 26 Jun 2013 12:36:20 +0200

tails (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features
  - Support obfs3 bridges.
  - Automatically install a custom list of additional packages chosen by
    the user at the beginning of every working session, and upgrade them
    once a network connection is established (technology preview).

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.6esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1.
  - Update Torbrowser patches to current maint-2.4 branch (567682b).
  - Isolate DOM storage to first party URI, and enable DOM storage:
    don't set dom.storage.enabled anymore, and set Torbutton's
    disable_domstorage to false.
  - Isolate the image cache per url bar domain.
  - Torbutton 1.5.2, and various prefs hacks to fix breakage:
    · Add .saved version of the Torbutton preferences the TBB also sets.
    · Set TOR_SOCKS_HOST and TOR_SOCKS_PORT.
    · Move some prefs (network.proxy.*, extensions.autoDisableScopes,
      extensions.foxyproxy.last-version) to user.js.
      Else, with Torbutton 1.5.x, these ones are not taken into account.
    · Set network.proxy.socks_version.
      Else we get the meaningless user_pref("network.proxy.socks_version", 9063);
      in prefs.js after the initial startup.
    · Set extensions.foxyproxy.socks_remote_dns to true.
      Else, it overrides the various ways we set network.proxy.socks_remote_dns,
      which in turn makes Torbutton think it should start in non-Tor mode.
    · Also pass the TOR_SOCKS_* environment variables to iceweasel when
      generating the profile: Torbutton behaves differently depending on
      these variables, so we don't want the initial profile generation to be
      done without them. In practice, this has no implication that we could
      see right now, but better safe than sorry.
    · Import all version overrides from the TBB prefs.
      Else, the User-Agent sent in the HTTP headers is fine, but real
      values leak with JavaScript, as demonstrated by ip-check's "Browser
      type" test.
    · Move a bunch of settings to user_pref(), that are not applied otherwise.
      For some, this fixes a regression in 0.18~rc1.
      For other, the  bug was already present in Tails 0.17.2.
  - HTTPS Everywhere 3.2.
  - Update prefs to match the TBB's, fix bugs, and take advantage of the latest
    Torbrowser patches:
    · Increase pipeline randomization.
    · Fix @font-face handling of local() fonts.
      Also disable fallback font rendering.
    · Explicitly disable SPDY v2 and v3.
    · Update http pipelining prefs.
  - Make prefs organization closer to the TBB's:
    · Remove Torbutton prefs that we set at their default value.
    · Import Torbutton preferences from the TBB.
    · Organize iceweasel config files in sections the same way as the TBB.
  - Cleanup prefs:
    · Don't set extensions.torbutton.clear_cookies nor
      extensions.torbutton.saved.share_proxy_settings:
      we don't care about toggling anymore.
    · Don't set extensions.torbutton.saved.download_retention nor
      extensions.torbutton.saved.search_suggest:
      these settings are not used in Torbutton anymore.
  - Update unsafe browser prefs mangling accordingly.
  - Move network.protocol-handler.warn-external.* to user_pref().
    Else they're not applied.
    These prefs are actually ignored by Firefox these days -- the TBB
    design doc reads "They are set still anyway out of respect for the
    dead". Let's go on doing the same.
  - Update extensions.adblockplus.currentVersion.
  - Fetch xul-ext-https-everywhere (3.2-2) and xul-ext-noscript (2.6.6.1-1)
    from Debian unstable. They were uploaded there, and accordingly removed
    from experimental.

  * Bugfixes
  - Linux 3.2.41-2+deb7u2.
  - Fixed swapped filenames of tails-{reboot,shutdown}.desktop.
    Thanks to Mikko Harhanen for the patch.
  - Only add ClientTransportPlugin to torrc when bridge mode is enabled.
    This should bring back support for proxies of type other than obfsproxy.

  * Minor improvements
  - Set kernel.dmesg_restrict=1, and make /proc/<pid>/ invisible
    and restricted for other users. It makes it slightly harder for an attacker
    to gather information that may allow them to escalate privileges.
  - Install gnome-screenshot.
  - Don't disable IPv6 on all network interfaces anymore.
    It turns out the IPv6 leaks we wanted to fix actually don't exist.
  - Add a "About Tails" launcher in the System menu.
  - Install GNOME accessibility themes.
  - Use 'Getting started...' as the homepage for Tails documentation button.
  - Stop relying on the obsolete /live/image compatibility symlink.
  - Disable audio preview in Nautilus.
  - Wheezy was released => Squeeze is now oldstable.
  - Pick Tor from deb.torproject.org regardless of the release name they
    advertise. At some point we needed it, their APT repository still thought
    that stable == Squeeze.
  - Add Wheezy APT sources.
  - Install Linux and related packages from Wheezy.
    Debian sid just got Linux 3.8, and we don't want to switch to a new kernel
    yet.
  - Fetch laptop-mode-tools from Wheezy.
    Wheezy has the version we've been installing in 0.18~rc1,
    while a newer one was uploaded to sid in the meantime.
  - Fetch a few packages from Wheezy instead of unstable.
    Namely: spice-vdagent, libregexp-common-perl, macchanger, service-wrapper,
    libservice-wrapper-java and libservice-wrapper-jni.
    Wheezy has the versions we've been installing for a while, so let's
    avoid having unstable push a newer one to us uselessly at some point.
    Note that at the time of this writing, the versions in sid and in Wheezy
    are the same, so this commit is effectively a no-op as of today: it is
    merely a safeguard for the future.

  * Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.

  * Build process
  - Make Vagrant's build-tails script support Jenkins too.

  * Test suite
  - Fix Unsafe Browser test broken by hidepid.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.5esr-0+tails2~bpo60+1.
  - Stop displaying obsolete context menu entries ("Open Tor URL" and friends).

  * Hardware support
  - Update Linux to 3.2.41-2

  * Bugfixes
  - Use more reliable OpenPGP keyservers:
    · use the hkps pool in GnuPG (and import their SSL CA)
    · use hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net in Seahorse (as it does not support
      hkps yet)
  - Keep udisks users (GNOME Disk Utility, tails-persistence-setup, etc.)
    from resetting the system partition's attributes when manipulating the
    partition table. To this end, backport the relevant bugfix from Wheezy
    into parted 2.3-5+tails1. This allowed to remove the sgdisk-based
    workaround in tais-persistence-setup, and to stop installing
    python-parted. All this is a first needed step to fix
    todo/make_system_disk_read-only in a future release.

  * Minor improvements
  - Disable NoScript's HTML5 media click-to-play for better user experience.

  * Localization
  - Tails USB installer: update translations for French, German, Spanish,
    Finnish, Greek, Italian, Latvian, Dutch, Polish and Chinese.
  - Tails Greeter: update translations for Farsi, Chinese, French;
    new translations: Finnish, Norwegian Bokmål, Galician.
  - tails-persistence-setup: update Farsi and Chinese translations;
    import new translations for Finnish and Swedish.
  - WhisperBack: update translations for Arabic, French, German, Greek,
    Spanish, Korean, Polish, Russian. New translations: Finnish, Chinese.

  * Build process
  - Add automated testing framework (Sikuli, Cucumber, libvirt -based)
    with a bunch of tests.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.4esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1.

  * Hardware support
  - Update Linux to 3.2.39-2.
    It includes the drm and agp subsystems from Linux 3.4.29.
  - Don't install xserver-xorg-video-rendition backport.
    xserver-xorg-video-rendition has been removed from squeeze-backports
    due to an upstream tarball mismatch discover when merging backports
    into the main Debian archive, and xserver-xorg-video-all still depends
    on it, so we explicitly install all drivers from -all but -rendition
    as a (hopefully temporary) workaround.

  * Minor improvements
  - Remove Indymedia IRC account, until we ship a version of Pidgin
    with SASL support, that is when Tails is based on Wheezy.

  * Build system
  - Don't ship the wiki's todo and bugs on ISO images.

  * New features
  - Install the KeePassX password manager, with a configuration and
    documentation that makes it easy to persist the password database.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.3esr-1+tails1~bpo60+1.
  - Install xul-ext-adblock-plus from squeeze-backports.
  - Do not allow listing all available fonts.
    Set browser.display.max_font_attempts and browser.display.max_font_count
    to enable the Torbrowser Limit-the-number-of-fonts-per-document patch.
  - Set default spellchecker dictionary to English (USA),
    and localize it according to locale with our custom branding extension.
  - Disable the add-ons automatic update feature.
  - Make the generated profile world-readable.
  - Remove NoScript click-to-play confirmation.
  - Sync some prefs set by Torbutton, to be ready when it stops setting these.
  - Disable navigation timing.
  - Disable SPDY. It stores state and may have keepalive issues.
  - More aggressive iceweasel HTTP pipelining settings.
  - Enable WebGL (as click-to-play only).
  - Disable network.http.connection-retry-timeout.
  - Disable full path information for plugins.
  - Remove NoScript blocks of WebFonts.
  - Disable DOM storage in Torbutton.
    Since we don't apply the 0026-Isolate-DOM-storage-to-first-party-URI.patch
    Torbrowser patch yet, and still disable DOM storage, we need to tell
    Torbutton not to use it.
  - Synchronize iceweasel's general.useragent.override with TBB based on FF17.
    The User-Agent settings are not kept up-to-date anymore in Torbutton, so
    we have to keep in sync manually with TBB's settings.
  - Remove obsolete APT pining for Torbutton.
    It's not maintained in Debian anymore, so we now fetch it from our own
    APT repository.
  - Fetch FoxyProxy from Debian experimental and libnspr4-0d from
    squeeze-backports, for compatibility with Iceweasel 17.
  - Rebase bookmarks file on top of the default iceweasel 17 one.
  - Explicitly disable AdBlock Plus "correct typos" feature.
    This feature connects to http://urlfixer.org/.
    It is disabled by default in 2.2-1, but let's be careful.

  * Minor improvements
  - Upgrade to live-boot 3.0~b11-1 and live-config 3.0.12-1.
    Accordingly update the 9980-permissions hook, live-persist,
    unsafe-browser and boot-profile.
    Add compatibility symlinks from /live to /lib/live, and from /live/image
    to /lib/live/mount/medium, to ease the transition.
  - Check for errors when sourcing live-boot files, e.g. to detect when
    they have been renamed upstream.
  - Don't add "quiet" to the kernel command-line ourselves.
    Else, it appears twice as live-build's lb_binary_syslinux adds it too.
    Historically, we've been adding it ourselves on top of that because
    lb_binary_yaboot does not add it, but since we gave up the PowerPC support
    attempt, we're now only interested in syslinux, so let's make it easier
    for the general case, e.g. when one wants to remove the "quiet" parameter
    as suggested by our "Tails does not start" debugging documentation.
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.4.

  * Bugfixes
  - Many bugfixes brought by the Debian Squeeze 6.0.7 point-release.
  - Use the regular GnuPG agent + pinentry-gtk2 instead of Seahorse
    as a GnuPG agent. This fixes usage of OpenPGP in Claws Mail,
    and brings support for OpenPGP smartcards.
  - Enable I2P hidden mode.
    Else, killing I2P ungracefully is bad for the I2P network.
  - live-persist: move error() function before the first potential usecase.
  - Add missing executable bit on restart-tor and restart-vidalia.
  - Add shutdown and reboot launchers to the menu.
    This workarounds the lack of a shutdown helper applet in camouflage mode.
  - Remove Pidgin's MXit and Sametime support.
    ... at least until CVE-2013-0273, CVE-2013-0272 and CVE-2013-0271 are
    fixed in Debian stable. While we're at it, don't force file removal in
    these "set -e" build scripts: fail hard, instead of silently ignoring
    the fact that files may have moved or disappeared.

  * Hardware support
  - Install recent Intel and AMD microcode from squeeze-backports,
    explicitly excluding the iucode-tool package that's not a good idea
    for Live systems.
  - Install firmware loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets.
    This is needed to have various mobile broadband chipsets work.
  - Upgrade barry to 0.18.3-5~bpo60+1.
    This much improved new version supports more hardware & ISP,
    and does not display dozens of spurious error messages at boot time.

  * Build system
  - Remove APT local cache (/Var/cache/apt/{,src}pkgcache.bin).

tails (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor improvements
  - Replace the too-easy-to-misclick shutdown button with a better
    "Shutdown Helper" Gnome applet.
  - Display ~/Persistent in GNOME Places and GtkFileChooser if it is mounted.
  - Set Unsafe Browser's window title to "Unsafe Browser".
  - Install ekeyd to support the EntropyKey.
  - Install font for Sinhala.
  - Update Poedit to 1.5.4.
  - Kill Vidalia when restarting Tor.
    Doing this as early as possible exposes Vidalia's "broken onion" icon
    to users less.
  - Hide the persistence setup launchers in kiosk mode.
  - Add a shell library for Tor functions.
    These are shared among multiple of our scripts.
  - Install dictionaries for supported languages.
    Install hunspell dictionaries when possible,
    fall back on myspell ones else.

  * Bugfixes
  - Disable IPv6 on all network interfaces.
    This is a workaround for the IPv6 link-local multicast leak that was recently
    discovered. Tails has no local service that listens on IPv6, so there should be
    no regression, hopefully, unless one wants to play with OnionCat and VoIP,
    but those of us should know how to workaround this anyway.
  - live-persist: Fix variable mismatch, fixing probe white-list.
    Tails may previously have been able to list GPT partitions labelled
    "TailsData" on hard drives (!) as valid persistence volumes...
  - live-persist: Fix --media option when no devices are attached.
    Earlier, if it was set to e.g. 'removable-usb' and no USB storage was
    connected, $whitelistdev would be empty, which is interpreted like
    all devices are ok by the rest of the code.
  - Fix SCIM in the autostarted web browser: save IM environment variables
    to a file during Desktop session startup, and export them into the
    autostarted browser's environment.
  - Talk of DVD, not of CD, in the shutdown messages.
  - Make tordate work in bridge mode with an incorrect clock.
    When using a bridge Tor reports TLS cert lifetime errors (e.g. when
    the system clock is way off) with severity "info", but when no bridge
    is used the severity is "warn". tordate/20-time.sh depends on grepping
    these error messages, so we termporarily increase Tor's logging
    severity when using bridge mode. If we don't do this tordate will
    sleep forever, leaving Tor in a non-working state.
    · White-list root to use Tor's ControlPort.
    · Add logging for is_clock_way_off().
    · Remove Tor's log before time syncing.
      We depend on grepping stuff from the Tor log (especially for
      tordate/20-time.sh), so deleting it seems like a Good Thing(TM).
    · Stop Tor before messing with its log or data dir.
  - live-persist: limit searched devices the same way as live-boot.
    If no --media argument is specified, use live-boot's
    "(live-media|bootfrom)=removable(|-usb)" argument to limit devices
    searched for a persistent volume.
  - tails-greeter: do not pass media=removable to live-persist.
    Now that we have autodetection with kernel command-line,
    it should not be needed anymore.
  - Start memlockd after configuring it,
    instead of starting it before and restarting it after.
    This avoids running memlockd twice, and prevents other possibly
    surprising race-conditions.
    As a consequence, also have tails-sdmem-on-media-removal start after the
    memlockd service *and* tails-reconfigure-memlockd: to start the watchdog,
    we need memlockd to be properly configured *and* running.

  * iceweasel
  - Set iceweasel homepage to the news section on the Tails website.
    ... using the localized one when possible.
  - Hide the iceweasel add-on bar by default.
    Now that we don't want to ship the Monkeysphere addon anymore,
    that was the only one displayed in there, we can as well hide the whole bar.
  - Don't hide the AdBlock-Plus button in the add-on bar anymore. Now that
    we hide the whole addon bar, we can get rid of this old
    UX improvement.
  - Do not install a placeholder (fake) FireGPG iceweasel extension anymore.
    It was shipped from 0.10 (early 2012) to 0.15 (late November),
    so the migration period should be over now.
  - Don't install xul-ext-monkeysphere anymore.
    The implication of the current keyserver policy are not well
    understood, Monkeysphere is little used in Tails, and we're not sure
    anymore it would be our first bet for the web browser profile with no
    CA. Let's keep the various configuration bits (e.g. FoxyProxy,
    patching MSVA), though, so that advanced users who are used to have
    Monkeysphere in Tails just have to install the package.

  * Build system
  - Install the "standard" task with tasksel for better consistency in the
    Tails ISO images built in various environments.
  - Install p7zip-full. It's a dep by file-roller, but we explicily use it
    elsewhere, and it's better to be safe than sorry.
  - Remove pinning of libvpx0 to sid.
    This package is part of Squeeze, and not from testing/sid.
    We have been shipping the version from Squeeze for a while.
  - Remove config/chroot_local-packages/ from .gitignore.
    The documented way for "external" contributors to add custom packages
    is to put them in chroot_local-packages, and once we pull we import
    any such package into our APT repo and rewrite the
    history appropriately.
    Also, the ability to add packages in there and not see them in "git
    status" makes it very easy to build tainted ISO images with
    non-standard packages, which makes some of us fear can lead to hard to
    debug situations.
  - Make it clearer what can and cannot be done in terms of local packages.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Thu, 10 Jan 2013 12:47:42 +0100

tails (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Persistence for browser bookmarks.
  - Support for obfsproxy bridges.

  * Minor improvements
  - Add the Hangul (Korean) Input Method Engine for SCIM.
  - Add vendor-specific dpkg origin information. This makes dpkg-vendor
    return correct information.
  - Install pcscd and libccid from squeeze-backports. This is needed to
    support, to some extent, some OpenPGP SmartCard readers.
  - Install HPIJS PPD files and the IJS driver (hpijs).
    This adds support for some printers, such as Xerox DocumentCenter400.
  - Optimize fonts display for LCD.
  - Update TrueCrypt to version 7.1a.

  * Bugfixes
  - Do not use pdnsd anymore. It has been orphaned in Debian, has quite
    some bugs in there, and apparently Tor's DNSPort's own caching is
    be good enough.
  - Remove useless iceweasel cookies exceptions. They are useless as
    per-session cookies are allowed.
  - Do not run setupcon on X. This call is only needed on the Linux
    console, no need to annoy the user with a weird "Press enter to
    activate this console" when the open a root shell in a GNOME
    Terminal.
  - Allow the tails-iuk-get-target-file user to connect to the SOCKSPort
    dedicated for Tails-specific software.
  - Fix gpgApplet menu display in Windows camouflage mode.
  - Fix Tor reaching an inactive state if it's restarted in "bridge mode",
    e.g. during the time sync' process.

  * Iceweasel
  - Update iceweasel to 10.0.11esr-1+tails1.
  - User profile is now generated at build time in order to support persistent
    bookmarks.
  - Update HTTPS Everywhere to version 3.0.4.
  - Update NoScript to version 2.6.
  - Fix bookmark to I2P router console.
  - Re-enable Monkeysphere extension to connect to the validation agent.

  * Localization
  - The Tails USB installer, tails-persistence-setup and tails-greeter
    are now translated into Bulgarian.
  - Update Chinese translation for tails-greeter.
  - Update Euskadi translation for WhisperBack.

  * Build system
  - Custom packages are now retrieved from Tails APT repository instead
    of bloating the Git repository.
  - Allow '~' in wiki filenames. This makes it possible to ship
    update-description files for release candidates.
  - Document how to create incremental update kit.
  - Handle release candidates when generating custom APT sources.
  - Remove pinning for xul-ext-adblock-plus.
    It is obsolete since we've added this package to our APT repository.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2012 12:59:17 +0100

tails (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Enable Tor stream isolation; several new SocksPorts with
    appropriate Isolate* options have been added for different use
    cases (i.e. applications). All application's have been
    reconfigured to use these new SocksPorts, which should increase
    anonymity by making it more difficulte to correlate traffic from
    different applications or "online identities".
  - The web browser now has the anonymity enhancing patches from the
    TorBrowser applied.
  - gpgApplet can now handle public-key cryptography.
  - Install an additional, PAE-enabled kernel with NX-bit
    support. This kernel is auto-selected when the hardware supports
    it and will:
    * provide executable space protection, preventing certain types of
      buffer overflows from being exploitable.
    * enable more than 4 GiB of system memory.
    * make all processors/cores available, including their
      power-saving functionality.
  - Add a persistence preset for NetworkManager connections.

  * Minor improvements
  - On kexec reboot, make the boot quiet only if debug=wipemem was not
    enabled.
  - Update torproject.org's APT repo key.
  - Update the embedded Tails signing key.
  - Use symlinks instead of duplicating localized searchplugins.
  - Rewrite Tails firewall using ferm. Tails firewall was written in
    very unsophisticated iptables-save/restore format. As more feature
    creeped in, it started to be quite unreadable.
  - Optimize VirtualBox modules build at runtime to avoid installing the
    userspace utils N times.
  - Drop most of Vidalia's configuration. Our custom lines just caused
    trouble (with multiple SocksPorts) and the default works well.
  - Blacklist PC speaker module. On some computers, having the pcspkr
    module loaded means loud beeps at bootup, shutdown and when using
    the console. As it draws useless attention to Tails users, it is
    better to prevent Linux from loading it by default.
  - Remove all addons from the Unsafe Browser. No addons are essential
    for the Unsafe Browser's intent. If anything they will modify the
    network fingerprint compared to a normal Iceweasel install, which
    is undesirable.
  - Prevent some unwanted packages to be installed at all, rather than
    uninstalling them later. This should speed up the build a bit.
  - Add a symlink from /etc/live/config to /etc/live/config.d. This
    makes the system compatible with live-config 3.0.4-1, without
    breaking backward compatibility with various parts of the system
    that use the old path.
  - Do not run unecessary scripts during shutdown sequence, to make
    shutdown faster.
  - Make live-persist deal with persistent ~/.gconf subdirs so that
    any options saved therein actually get persistent.
  - Prevent memlockd unload on shutdown, to make sure that all
    necessary tools for memory wiping are available when the new
    kernel has kexec'd.
  - Patch initscripts headers instead of fiddling with update-rc.d. We
    now let insserv figure out the correct ordering for the services
    during startup and shutdown, i.e. use dependency-based boot
    sequencing.
  - Remove the last absolute path in our isolinux config, which makes
    it easier to migrate from isolinux to syslinux (just rename the
    directory), and hence might make it easier for 3rd party USB
    installers (like the Universal USB Installer) to support Tails.

  * Bugfixes
  - Include `seq` in the ramdisk environment: it is used to wipe more
    memory. This fixes the long-standing bug about Tails not cleaning
    all memory on shutdown.
  - Fix Yelp crashing on internal links
  - Allow amnesia user to use Tor's TransPort. This firewall exception
    is necessary for applications that doesn't have in-built SOCKS
    support and cannot use torsocks. One such example is Claws Mail,
    which uses tsocks since torsocks makes it leak the hostname. This
    exception, together with Tor's automatic .onion mapping makes
    Claws Mail able to use hidden service mail providers again.
  - Force threads locking support in Python DBus binding. Without this
    liveusb-creator doesn't work with a PAE-enabled kernel.
  - Fix localized search plugins for 'es' and 'pt'
  - Fix live-boot's readahead, which caused an unnecessary pause
    during boot.
  - Factorize GCC wanted / available version numbers in VirtualBox
    modules building hook. This, incidentally, fixes a bug caused by
    duplication and not updating all instances.
  - Fix tordate vs. Tor 0.2.3.x. Since 0.2.3.x Tor doesn't download a
    consensus for clocks that are more than 30 days in the past or 2
    days in the future (see commits f4c1fa2 and 87622e4 in Tor's git
    repo). For such clock skews we set the time to the Tor authority's
    cert's valid-after date to ensure that a consensus can be
    downloaded.

  * Tor
  - Update to version 0.2.3.24-rc-1~~squeeze+1, a new major
    version. It's not a stable release, but we have been assured by
    the Tor developers that this is the right move.
  - Stop setting custom value for the Tor LongLivedPorts
    setting. Gobby's port was upstreamed in Tor 0.2.3.x.

  * Iceweasel
  - Update to 10.0.10esr-1+tails1, which has all the anonymity enhancing
    patches from the TorBrowser applied.
  - Install iceweasel from our own repo, http://deb.tails.boum.org.
  - Fix Iceweasel's file associations. No more should you be suggested
    to open a PDF in the GIMP.

  * htpdate
  - Use curl instead of wget, and add a --proxy option passed through
    to curl.
  - Remove the --fullrequest option, we don't need it anymore.
  - Remove --dns-timeout option, we don't need it anymore.
  - Change --proxy handling to support Debian Squeeze's curl.
  - Clarify what happens if --proxy is not used.
  - Compute the median of the diffs more correctly.

  * Hardware support
  - Update Linux to 3.2.32-1.

  * Software
  - Update vidalia to 0.2.20-1+tails1.
  - Update bundled WhisperBack package to 1.6.2:
    * Raise the socket library timeout to 120 seconds
    * Use smtplib's timeout parameter
    * Fix error output when calling send a 2nd time
  - Update liveusb-creator to 3.11.6-3.
  - Update i2p to 0.9.2.
  - Update tails-persistence-setup to 0.20-1, which should make it
    possible to install Tails on large (>= 32 GiB) USB drives.
  - Install console-setup and keyboard-configuration from unstable
    (required by new initramfs-tools).
  - Update tails-greeter to 0.7.3:
    * Import pt_BR translation.
    * Let langpanel usable during option selection stage
    * Print less debugging messages by default
    (below are changes in tails-greeter 0.7.2:)
    * Use correct test operators.
    * Generate language codes of available locales at package build
      time.
    * Read list of language codes from where we have saved it at
      package build time.
    * Drop tails-lang-helper, not used anymore.
    * Do not compile locales at login time anymore. Tails now ships
      locales-all.
  - Import live-config{,-sysvinit} 3.0.8-1. live-config >= 3.0.9-1
    has basically nothing useful for us, and it migrates to new paths
    brought by live-boot 3.0~b7, which we're not ready for yet (see:
    todo/newer_live-boot).

  * Localization
  - Fix Tails specific Iceweasel localization for pt-BR
  - Add Japanese input system: scim-anthy.
  - whisperback is now also translated into German, Hebrew, Hungarian,
    Italian and Korean.
  - tails-persistence-setup is now also translated into Arabic.
  - tails-greeter is now also translated into Arabic, Hebrew, Basque,
    Hungarian, Italian and Chinese.

  * Build system
  - Catch more errors in during build time:
    - Ensure that all local hooks start with 'set -e'.
    - Fail hard if adduser fails in local hooks.
    - Fail hard if 'rm' fails in local hooks.
  - vagrant: Ensure we have the set of Perl packages needed by our
    Ikiwiki
  - vagrant: Configure live-build to ship with ftp.us.debian.org.
    Using cdn.debian.net leads to bad interactions with Tor.
  - vagrant: Don't use gzip compression when building from a tag, i.e.
    a release.
  - vagrant: Optionally use bootstrap stage cache for faster builds
    via the 'cache' build option.
  - vagrant: Make sure release builds are clean, i.e. they don't use
    any potentially dangerous build options.
  - vagrant: Disable live-build package caching. This build system is
    meant to use an external caching proxy, so live-build's cache just
    wastes RAM (for in-memory builds) or disk space.
  - vagrant: use aufs magic instead of copying source into tmpfs.
    This reduces the amount of RAM required for building Tails in.
  - vagrant: Allow in-memory builds when a VM with enough memory is
    already started.

tails (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Use white-list/principle of least privelege approach for local services.
    Only users that need a certain local (i.e. hosted on loopback) service
    (according to our use cases) are granted access to it by our firewall;
    all other users are denied access.
  - Ship a first version of the incremental update system. Updates are not
    currently triggered automatically, but this will allow tests to be done
    on larger scales.

  * Minor improvements
  - Enable four workspaces in the Windows XP camouflage. This allows
    users to quickly switch to a more innocent looking workspace in case
    they are working on sensitive data and attract unwanted attention.
    The workspace switcher applet isn't there, though, since there's no
    such thing in Windows XP, so switching is only possible via keyboard
    shortcuts.
  - Ship with precompiled locales instead of generating them upon login.
  - Add support for wireless regulation.
  - Use color for Git output, not intended for machine consumption,
    written to the terminal.
  - Have ttdnsd use OpenDNS. Using Google's DNS servers was very
    glitchy, and rarely succeeded when it should. It can probably be
    attributed to Google's DNS, which is known to take issue with Tor
    exits.
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.6, with many UI improvements and new translations.
  - Include GDM logs and dmidecode informations in the reports.
  - Allow to modify language and layout in the "Advanced options" screen
    of the greeter.
  - GnuPG: bump cert-digest-algo to SHA512.
  - Update torproject.org's APT repo key.

  * Bugfixes
  - Make Claws Mail save local/POP emails in its dot-directory. The
    default is to save them at ~/Mail, which isn't included in our
    current Claws Mail persistence preset.
  - Fix the System Monitor applet.
  - Remove broken ttdnsd from the default DNS resolution loop.
  - Hide the 'TailsData' partition in desktop applications.
  - Ship unrar-free again, so that the GNOME archive manager knows about
    it.
  - Ship with an empty whitelist for Noscript.
  - Disable FoxyProxy's advertisement on proxy error page.
  - Fix slow browsing experience for offline documentation.
  - Raise the socket timeout to 120 seconds in WhisperBack.
  - Enable the ikiwiki trail plugin for the locally built wiki too.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade iceweasel to 10.0.6esr-1 (Extended Support Release) and install it
    and its dependencies from squeeze-backports.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.23-1.

  * Software
  - Update tor to version 0.2.2.39.
  - Update Iceweasel to version 10.0.7esr-2.
  - Update i2p to version 0.9.1.

  * Build system
  - vagrant: Install Ikiwiki from Debian unstable. The 'mirrorlist'
    patches have finally been merged in upstream Ikiwiki. So instead of
    building Ikiwiki by hand, we can now install the package directly
    from Debian unstable.
  - Do not build the ikiwiki forum on the bundled static website copy.

tails (0.12.1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is a brown paper bag release to fix two major problems introduced in
  Tails 0.12.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade Torbutton to 1.4.6.
  - Upgrade AdBlock Plus to 2.1.
  - Update AdBlock Plus patterns.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.21-3 (linux-image-3.2.0-3-486).

  * Software
  - Install MAT from Debian backports, drop custom package.
  - Install python-pdfrw to re-add PDF support to the MAT.
  - Upgrade tails-greeter to 0.7.1, which fixes the race condition that
    broke administration password and locale settings on some systems.

  * Boot
  - Remove the Tails specific plymouth theme. The theme interfers heavily with
    the boot process on some hardware.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Mon, 17 Sep 2012 13:06:03 +0200

tails (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Add the Unsafe Web Browser, which has direct access to the Internet and
    can be used to login to captive portals.
  - The (previously experimental, now deemed stable) Windows camouflage can now
    be enabled via a check box in Tails greeter.

  * Tor
  - Upgrade to 0.2.2.37-1~~squeeze+1.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade iceweasel to 10.0.5esr-1 (Extended Support Release) and install it
    and its dependencies from squeeze-backports.
  - Add a bookmark for the offline Tails documentation.
  - Update AdBlock patterns.

  * Persistence
  - Allow using larger USB drives by increasing the mkfs timeout to 10 minutes.
  - Tell the user what's going on when the Tails boot device cannot be found.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.20-1 (linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64).

  * Software
  - Install rfkill.
  - Install torsocks. Note that this makes `torify' use `torsocks' instead of
    `tsocks'. The `tsocks' binary is dropped to avoid problems, but remaining
    files (the library) are kept since ttdnsd depends on them.
  - Fetch live-config-sysvinit from sid so that it matches live-config version.
  - Update virtualbox backports to 4.1.10-dfsg-1~bpo60+1.
  - Install pciutils (needed by virtualbox-guest-utils).
  - Install mousetweaks. This is needed to use the mouse accessibility settings
    in System -> Preferences -> Mouse -> Accessibility.
  - Install the "hardlink" files deduplicator.
  - Do not install cryptkeeper anymore. See todo/remove_cryptkeeper for reason.
    Users of cryptkeeper are encouraged to install cryptkeeper via `apt-get
    update; apt-get install --yes cryptkeeper`, open their volume and move
    their to Tails' built-in persistence instead, as a one-time migration.
  - Upgrade I2P to version 0.9.
  - Don't install GParted. GNOME Disk Utility has been on par with GParted
    since Squeeze was released.
  - Upgrade live-boot to 3.0~a27-1+tails2~1.gbp319fe6.
  - Upgrade live-config to 3.0~a39-1 and install it from Debian experimental.
  - Upgrade tails-greeter to 0.7.
  - Upgrade tails-persistence-setup to 0.17-1.
  - Install libyaml-libyaml-perl.
  - Upgrade MAT, the metadata anonymisation toolkit, 0.3.2-1~bpo60+1.
  - Fetch python-pdfrw from backports, drop custom package.

  * Internationalization
  - The Tails website and documentation now has a (partial) Portuguese
    translation.

  * Build system
  - Tails can now be built without using a HTTP proxy.
  - Tails can now easily be built by using Vagrant. See the updated
    contribute/build page for instructions.

  * Boot
  - Remove obsolete noswap boot parameter. live-boot now handles swap on an
    opt-in basis.
  - The squashfs.sort files generated with boot-profile should now be ok which
    makes the generate images boot noticeably faster on optical media. See
    bugs/weird_squashfs.sort_entries for more information.
  - Set Tails specific syslinux and plymouth themes.
  - Add NVidia KMS video drivers to the initrd in order to show our shiny new
    plymouth theme on more systems.

tails (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Do not grant the desktop user root credentials by default.
  - A graphical boot menu (tails-greeter 0.6.3) allows choosing among
    many languages, and setting an optional sudoer password.
  - Support opt-in targeted persistence
    · tails-persistence-setup 0.14-1
    · live-boot 3.0~a25-1+tails1~5.gbp48d06c
    · live-config 3.0~a35-1
  - USB installer: liveusb-creator 3.11.6-1

  * iceweasel
  - Install iceweasel 10.0.4esr-1 (Extended Support Release).
    Let's stop tracking a too fast moving target.
    Debian Wheezy will ship ESR versions.
  - Install needed dependencies from squeeze-backports.
  - Search plugins:
    · Remove bing.
      bing appeared due to our upgrading iceweasel.
      Removing it makes things consistent with the way they have been
      until now, that is: let's keep only the general search engines
      we've been asked to add, plus Google, and a few specialized ones.
    · Replace Debian-provided DuckDuckGo search plugin with the "HTML SSL"
      one, version 20110219. This is the non-JavaScript, SSL, POST flavour.
    · Add ixquick.com.
    · Install localized search engines in the correct place.
      No need to copy them around at boot time anymore.
    · Remove Scroogle. RIP.
  - Enable TLS false start, like the TBB does since December.
  - Adblock Plus: don't count and save filter hits, supress first run dialog.
  - Install neither the GreaseMonkey add-on, nor any GreaseMonkey script.
    YouTube's HTML5 opt-in program is over.
    HTML5 video support is now autodetected and used.

  * Vidalia
  - Upgrade to 0.2.17-1+tails1: drop Do-not-warn-about-Tor-version.patch,
    applied upstream.
  - Set SkipVersionCheck=true.
    Thanks to chiiph for implementing this upstream (needs Vidalia 0.2.16+).

  * Internationalization
  - Install all available iceweasel l10n packages.
  - Remove syslinux language choosing menu.
    tails-greeter allows choosing a non-English language.
  - Add fonts for Hebrew, Thai, Khmer, Lao and Korean languages.
  - Add bidi support.
  - Setup text console at profile time.
    Context: Tails runs with text console autologin on.
    These consoles now wait, using a "Press enter to activate this console"
    message, for the user. When they press enter in there, they should have chosen
    their preferred keyboard layout in tails-greeter by now. Then, we run setupcon.
    As a result, the resulting shell is properly localized, and setupcon
    sets the correct keyboard layout, both according to the preferences expressed by
    the user in tails-greeter.
  - Don't use localepurge, don't remove any Scribus translations anymore,
    don't localize environment at live-config time:
    tails-greeter allows us to support many, many more languages.

  * Hardware support
  - Linux 3.2.15-1 (linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64).
  - Fix low sound level on MacBook5,2.
  - Disable laptop-mode-tools automatic modules. This modules set often
    needs some amount of hardware-specific tweaking to work properly.
    This makes them rather not well suited for a Live system.

  * Software
  - Install GNOME keyring.
    This is needed so that NetworkManager remembers the WEP/WPA secrets
    for the time of a Tails session. Initialize GNOME keyring at user
    creation time.
  - Install usbutils to have the lsusb command.
  - Install the Traverso multitrack audio recorder and editor.

  * Miscellaneous
  - GNOME Terminal: keep 8192 scrollback lines instead of the smallish
    default.
  - Replaced tails-wifi initscript with laptop-mode-tools matching feature.
  - Disable gdomap service.
  - Fetch klibc-utils and libklibc from sid.
    The last initramfs-tools depends on these.
  - Set root password to "root" if debug=root is passed on the
    kernel cmdline. Allow setting root password on kernel cmdline via
    rootpw=. Looks like we implemented this feature twice.
  - Append a space on the kernel command line. This eases manually adding
    more options.
  - Rename sudoers.d snippets to match naming scheme.
    Sudo credentials that shall be unconditionally granted to the Tails
    default user are named zzz_*, to make sure they are applied.
  - WhisperBack: also include /var/log/live-persist and
    /var/lib/gdm3/tails.persistence.
  - Add a wrapper to torify whois.
  - Rework the VirtualBox guest modules building hook to support
    multiple kernels.
  - Consistently wait for nm-applet when waiting for user session to come up.
    Waiting for gnome-panel or notification-daemon worked worse.
  - Don't start the NetworkManager system service via init.
    Some Tails NM hooks need the user to be logged in to run properly.
    That's why tails-greeter starts NetworkManager at PostLogin time.
  - Also lock /bin/echo into memory. For some reason, kexec-load needs it.
  - Pidgin: don't use the OFTC hidden service anymore.
    It proved to be quite unreliable, being sometimes down for days.
  - Do not display storage volumes on Desktop, by disabling
    /apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible GConf entry. Enabling that
    GConf setting avoids displaying the bind-mounted persistent
    directories on the Desktop, and reduces user confusion. It also is
    a first step towards a bigger UI change: GNOME3 does not manage the
    Desktop anymore, so volume icons and other Desktop icons are meant to
    disappear anyway. It implies we'll have to move all Desktop icons
    elsewhere. Let's start this move now: this will smooth the UI change
    Wheezy will carry for our users, by applying some of it progressively.

  * Build system
  - Don't build hybrid ISO images anymore. They boot less reliably on
    a variety of hardware, and are made less useful by us shipping
    a USB installer from now on.
  - Append .conf to live-config configuration filenames:
    live-config >3.0~a36-1 only takes into account files named *.conf
    in there. Accordingly update scripts that source these files.
  - Remove long-obsolete home-refresh script and its configuration.

  * Virtualization support
  - Support Spice and QXL: install the Spice agent from Debian sid,
    install xserver-xorg-video-qxl from squeeze-backports.

tails (0.10.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
  - Update to 10.0.2-1.
  - Disable HTTPS-Everywhere's SSL Observatory (plus first-run pop-up).
  - Revert "FoxyProxy: don't enclose regexps between ^ and $."
    Currently "http://www.i2p2.de" (and everything similar) is captured by
    the I2P filter, which is incorrect. It seems isMultiLine="false" does
    *not* make RE into ^RE$ any longer.
  - Remove file:// from NoScript's exception lists.
    This will fix the JavaScript toggles in the local copy of the documentation.
  - Update AdBlock patterns.

  * Software
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.8.13.
  - Install libvpx0 from sid.
  - Fetch klibc-utils and libklibc from sid.
    The last initramfs-tools depends on these.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.2.7-1.
  - Install firmware-libertas.
    This adds support for wireless network cards with Marvell Libertas
    8xxx chips supported by the libertas_cs, libertas_sdio, libertas_spi,
    libertas_tf_usb, mwl8k and usb8xxx drivers.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Revert "Set time to middle of [valid-after, fresh-until] from consensus."
    This reverts commit 18d23a500b9412b4b0fbe4e38a9398eb1a3eadef.
    With this vmid clocks that are E minutes back in time may cause issues
    (temporary Tor outages) after consensus updates that happen at the
    (60-E):th minute or later during any hour. Full analysis:
    https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-January/000873.html
  - Add the default user to the vboxsf group.
    This will allow the user to get full access to automounted VirtualBox
    shared folders as they are mounted with guid vboxsf and rwx group
    permissions.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Thu, 01 Mar 2012 20:26:21 +0100

tails (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
  - Make Startpage the default web search engine. Scroogle does not look
    reliable enough these days.

  * Software
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5.1 (update link to bug reporting documentation).
  - Update MAT to 0.2.2-2~bpo60+1 (fixes a critical bug in the GUI).

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.2.1-2

  * Time synchronization
    Serious rework that should fix most, if not all, of the infamous
    time-sync' related bugs some Tails users have experienced recently.
    - Make htpdate more resilient by using three server pools, and
      allowing some failure ratio.
    - Set time from Tor's unverified-consensus if needed.
    - Set time to middle of [valid-after, fresh-until] from consensus.
    - Many robustness, performance and fingerprinting-resistance improvements.
    - Display time-sync' notification much earlier.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fix access to "dumb" git:// protocol by using a connect-socks wrapper
    as GIT_PROXY_COMMAND.
  - SSH client: fix access to SSH servers on the Internet by correcting
    Host / ProxyCommand usage.
  - Pidgin: use OFTC hidden service to workaround Tor blocking.
  - Claws Mail: disable draft autosaving.
    When composing PGP encrypted email, drafts are saved back to
    the server in plaintext. This includes both autosaved and manually
    saved drafts.
  - tails-security-check-wrapper: avoid eating all memory when offline.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 28 Jan 2012 10:00:31 +0100

tails (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tor: upgrade to 0.2.2.35-1.

  * Iceweasel
  - Install Iceweasel 9.0 from the Debian Mozilla team's APT repository.
  - Update Torbutton to 1.4.5.1-1.
  - Support viewing any YouTube video that is available in HTML5 format:
    install xul-ext-greasemonkey and the "Permanently Enable HTML5 on
    YouTube" GreaseMonkey script.
  - Stop using Polipo in Iceweasel. Its SOCKS support was fixed.
  - Install from Debian sid the iceweasel extensions we ship,
    for compatibility with FF9.
  - Use Scroogle (any languages) instead of Scroogle (English only) when
    booted in English. Many users choose English because their own
    language is not supported yet; let's not hide them search results in
    their own language.
  - Install Iceweasel language packs from Debian unstable:
    unfortunately they are not shipped on the mozilla.debian.net repository.
  - Install the NoScript Firefox extension; configure it the same way as
    the TBB does.
  - Disable third-party cookies.
    They can be used to track users, which is bad. Besides, this is what
    TBB has been doing for years.
  - FoxyProxy: allow direct connections to RFC1918 IPs.

  * Do not transparent proxy outgoing Internet connections through Tor.
  - Torify the SSH client using connect-proxy to all IPs but RFC1918 ones.
  - Torify APT using Polipo HTTP.
  - Torify wget in wgetrc.
  - Torify gobby clients using torsocks. It does not support proxies yet.
  - Torify tails-security-check using LWP::UserAgent's SOCKS proxy support.
  - Fix enabling of GNOME's HTTP proxy.

  * Software
  - Upgrade Vidalia to 0.2.15-1+tails1.
    · New upstream release.
    · Do not warn about Tor version.
  - Upgrade MAT to 0.2.2-1~bpo60+1.
  - Upgrade VirtualBox guest software to 4.1.6-dfsg-2~bpo60+1,
    built against the ABI of X.Org backports.
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.8.11 using KillYourTV's Squeeze packages;
    additionally, fix its start script that was broken by the tordate merge.
  - Install unar (The Unarchiver) instead of the non-free unrar.
  - Install Nautilus Wipe instead of custom Nautilus scripts.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.1.6-1.
  - Upgrade to X.Org from squeeze-backports.
  - Install more, and more recent b43 firmwares.
  - Upgrade barry to 0.15-1.2~bpo60+1.

  * Internationalization
  - Add basic language support for Russian, Farsi and Vietnamese.
  - Install some Indic fonts.
  - Install some Russian fonts.
  - Add Alt+Shift shortcut to switch keyboard layout.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Support booting in "Windows XP -like camouflage mode":
    · Install homebrewn local .debs for a Windows XP look-alike Gnome theme.
    · Add the "Windows XP Bliss" desktop wallpaper.
    · Added a script that's sets up Gnome to look like Microsoft Windows XP.
    · Add Windows XP "camouflage" icons for some programs.
    · Make Iceweasel use the IE icon when Windows XP camouflage is enabled.
    · Add special launcher icons for the Windows XP theme so that they're
      not too big.
  - Decrease Florence focus zoom to 1.2.
  - Do not fetch APT translation files. Running apt-get update is heavy enough.
  - Add MSN support thanks to msn-pecan.
  - Add custom SSH client configuration:
    · Prefer strong ciphers and MACs.
    · Enable maximum compression level.
     · Explicitly disable X11 forwarding.
    · Connect as root by default, to prevent fingerprinting when username
      was not specified.
  - Replace flawed FireGPG with a home-made GnuPG encryption applet;
    install a feature-stripped FireGPG that redirects users to
    the documentation, and don't run Seahorse applet anymore.
  - Enable Seahorse's GnuPG agent.
  - Blank screen when lid is closed, rather than shutting down the system.
    The shutdown "feature" has caused data losses for too many people, it seems.
    There are many other ways a Tails system can be shut down in a hurry
    these days.
  - Import Tails signing key into the keyring.
  - Fix bug in the Pidgin nick generation that resulted in the nick
    "XXX_NICK_XXX" once out of twenty.
  - Pre-configure the #tor IRC discussion channel in Pidgin.
  - Fix "technology preview" of bridge support: it was broken by tordate merge.
  - Install dependencies of our USB installer to ease its development.
  - Make vidalia NM hook sleep only if Vidalia is already running.
  - Reintroduce the htpdate notification, telling users when it's safe
    to use Tor Hidden Services.
  - htpdate: omit -f argument to not download full pages.
  - htpdate: write success file even when not within {min,max}adjust.
    Otherwise htpdate will not "succeed" when the time diff is 0 (i.e.
    the clock was already correct) so the success file cannot be used
    as an indicator that the system time now is correct, which arguably
    is its most important purpose.

  * Build system
  - Name built images according to git tag.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Wed, 04 Jan 2012 09:56:38 +0100

tails (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tor
  - Upgrade to 0.2.2.34 (fixes CVE-2011-2768, CVE-2011-2769).

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to 3.5.16-11 (fixes CVE-2011-3647, CVE-2011-3648, CVE-2011-3650).
  - Upgrade FireGPG to 0.8-1+tails2: notify users that the FireGPG Text
    Editor is the only safe place for performing cryptographic operations,
    and make it impossible to do otherwise. Other ways open up several
    severe attacks through JavaScript (e.g. leaking plaintext when
    decrypting, signing messages written by the attacker).
  - Install Cookie Monster extension instead of CS Lite.
  - Always ask where to save files.
  - Upgrade Torbutton to 1.4.4.1-1, which includes support for the in-browser
    "New identity" feature.

  * Software
  - Install MAT, the metadata anonymisation toolkit.
  - Upgrade TrueCrypt to 7.1.
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5~rc1 (leads the user by the hand if an error
    occurs while sending the bugreport, proposes to save it after 2 faild
    attempts, numerous bugfixes).
  - Linux: upgrade to linux-image-3.0.0-2-486 (version 3.0.0-6); fixes
    a great number of bugs and security issues.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fully rework date and time setting system.
  - Remove the htp user firewall exception.
  - Saner keyboard layouts for Arabic and Russian.
  - Use Plymouth text-only splash screen at boot time.
  - Color the init scripts output.
  - Suppress Tor's warning about applications doing their own DNS lookups.
    This is totally safe due to our Tor enforcement.
  - Disable hdparm boot-time service.
    We only want hdparm so that laptop-mode-tools can use it.
  - Run Claws Mail using torify.
    It's not as good as if Claws Mail supported SOCKS proxies itself,
    but still better than relying on the transparent netfilter torification.
  - Install HPLIP and hpcups for better printing support.

  * Erase memory at shutdown
  - Run many sdmem instances at once.
    In hope of erasing more memory until we come up with a proper fix for
    [[bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]].
  - Kill gdm3 instead of using its initscript on brutal shutdown.
  - Use absolute path to eject for more robust memory wipe on boot medium removal.

  * Space savings
  - Exclude kernel and initramfs from being put into the SquashFS.
    Those files are already shipped where they are needed, that is in the ISO
    filesystem. Adapt kexec and memlockd bits.
  - Do not ship the GNOME icon theme cache.
  - Do not ship .pyc files.
  - Do not ship NEWS.Debian.gz files.

  * Build system
  - Re-implement hook that modifies syslinux config to make future
    development easier.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Tue, 01 Nov 2011 13:26:38 +0100

tails (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
    - Update to 3.5.16-10 (fixes DSA-2313-1).
    - FireGPG: force crypto action results to appear in a new window, otherwise
      JavaScript can steal decrypted plaintext. Advice: always use FireGPG's
      text editor when writing text you want to encrypt. If you write it in a
      textbox the plaintext can be stolen through JavaScript before it is
      encrypted in the same way.
    - Update HTTPS Everywhere extension to 1.0.3-1.
    - Stop using the small version of the Tor check page. The small version
      incorrectly tells Tails users to upgrade their Torbrowser, which has
      confused some users.

  * Software
    - Update Linux to 3.0.0-2 (fixes DSA-2310-1, CVE-2011-2905, CVE-2011-2909,
      CVE-2011-2723, CVE-2011-2699, CVE-2011-1162, CVE-2011-1161).
    - Update usb-modeswitch to 1.1.9-2~bpo60+1 and usb-modeswitch-data to
      20110805-1~bpo60+1 from Debian backports. This adds support for a few
      devices such as Pantech UMW190 CDMA modem.
    - Install libregexp-common-perl 2011041701-3 from Debian unstable. This
      fixes the bug: [[bugs/msva_does_not_use_configured_keyserver]].
    - Install hdparm so the hard drives can be spinned down in order to save
      battery power.
    - Install barry-util for better BlackBerry integration.
    - Debian security upgrades: OpenOffice.org (DSA-2315-1), openjdk-6
      (DSA-2311-1), policykit-1 (DSA-2319-1)

   * Protecting against memory recovery
    - Set more appropriate Linux VM config before wiping memory. These
      parameters should make the wipe process more robust and efficient.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 16 Oct 2011 11:31:18 +0200

tails (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebase on the Debian Squeeze 6.0.2.1 point-release.

  * Tor
    - Update to 0.2.2.33-1.
    - Disabled ControlPort in favour of ControlSocket.
    - Add port 6523 (Gobby) to Tor's LongLivedPorts list.

  * I2P
    - Update to 0.8.8.
    - Start script now depends on HTP since I2P breaks if the clock jumps or is
      too skewed during bootstrap.

  * Iceweasel
    - Update to 3.5.16-9 (fixes CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2376, CVE-2011-2365,
      CVE-2011-2373, CVE-2011-2371, CVE-2011-0083, CVE-2011-2363, CVE-2011-0085,
      CVE-2011-2362, CVE-2011-2982, CVE-2011-2981, CVE-2011-2378, CVE-2011-2984,
      CVE-2011-2983).
    - Enable HTTP pipelining (like TBB).
    - Update HTTPS Everywhere extension to 1.0.1-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Suppress FoxyProxy update prompts.
    - Prevent FoxyProxy from "phoning home" after a detected upgrade.
    - Fixed a bunch of buggy regular expressions in FoxyProxy's configuration.
      See [[bugs/exploitable_typo_in_url_regex?]] for details. Note that none of
      these issues are critical due to the transparent proxy.
    - Add DuckDuckGo SSL search engine.

  * Torbutton
    - Update to torbutton 1.4.3-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Don't show Torbutton status in the status bar as it's now displayed in the
      toolbar instead.

  * Pidgin
    - More random looking nicks in pidgin.
    - Add IRC account on chat.wikileaks.de:9999.

  * HTP
    - Upgrade htpdate script (taken from Git 7797fe9) that allows setting wget's
      --dns-timeout option.

  * Software
    - Update Linux to 3.0.0-1. -686 is now deprecated in favour of -486 and
      -686-pae; the world is not ready for -pae yet, so we now ship -486.
    - Update OpenSSL to 0.9.8o-4squeeze2 (fixes CVE-2011-1945 (revoke
      compromised DigiNotar certificates), CVE-2011-1945).
    - Update Vidalia to 0.2.14-1+tails1 custom package.
    - Install accessibility tools:
      - gnome-mag: screen magnifier
      - gnome-orca: text-to-speech
    - Replace the onBoard virtual keyboard with Florence.
    - Install the PiTIVi non-linear audio/video editor.
    - Install ttdnsd.
    - Install tor-arm.
    - Install lzma.

  * Arbitrary DNS queries
    - Tor can not handle all types of DNS queries, so if the Tor resolver fails
      we fallback to ttdnsd. This is now possible with Tor 0.2.2.x, since we
      fixed Tor bug #3369.

  * Hardware support
    - Install ipheth-utils for iPhone tethering.
    - Install xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (for mouse integration with the host OS
      in VMWare and KVM).
    - Install virtualbox-ose 4.x guest packages from Debian backports.

  * Miscellaneous
    - Switch gpg to use keys.indymedia.org's hidden service, without SSL.
      The keys.indymedia.org SSL certificate is now self-signed. The hidden
      service gives a good enough way to authenticate the server and encrypts
      the connection, and just removes the certificates management issue.
    - The squashfs is now compressed using XZ which reduces the image size quite
      drastically.
    - Remove Windows autorun.bat and autorun.inf. These files did open a static
      copy of our website, which is not accessible any longer.

  * Build system
    - Use the Git branch instead of the Debian version into the built image's
      filename.
    - Allow replacing efficient XZ compression with quicker gzip.
    - Build and install documentation into the chroot (-> filesystem.squashfs).
      Rationale: our static website cannot be copied to a FAT32 filesystem due
      to filenames being too long. This means the documentation cannot be
      browsed offline from outside Tails. However, our installer creates GPT
      hidden partitions, so the doc would not be browseable from outside Tails
      anyway. The only usecase we really break by doing so is browsing the
      documentation while running a non-Tails system, from a Tails CD.

  - FoxyProxy: install from Debian instead of the older one we previously
    shipped.

    from accidentaly / unconsciously put their anonymity at risk.
  - "amnesia branding" extension: bump Iceweasel compatibility to 4.0 to ease
    development of future releases.

  - Upgrade Linux kernel to Debian's 2.6.32-33: fixes tons of bugs,
    including the infamous missing mouse cursor one. Oh, and it closes
    a few security holes at well.
  - Install unrar-free.
  - Do not install pppoeconf (superseeded by NetworkManager).
  - Upgrade macchanger to Debian testing package to ease development of
    future Tails releases.
  - Debian security upgrades: x11-xserver-utils (DSA-2213-1), isc-dhcp
    (DSA-2216-1), libmodplug (DSA-2226-1), openjdk-6 (DSA-2224-1).

  * Protecting against memory recovery
  - Add Italian translation for tails-kexec. Thanks to Marco A. Calamari.
  - Make it clear what it may mean if the system does not power off
    automatically.
  - Use kexec's --reset-vga option that might fix display corruption issues
    on some hardware.

  * WhisperBack (encrypted bug reporting software)
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.4.1:
    localizes the documentation wiki's URL,
    uses WebKit to display the bug reporting help page,
    now is usable on really small screens.
  - Extract wiki's supported languages at build time, save this
    information to /etc/amnesia/environment, source this file into the
    Live user's environment so that WhisperBack 1.4+ can make good use
    of it.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fix boot in Chinese.
  - Install mobile-broadband-provider-info for better 3G support.
  - Add back GNOME system icons to menus.
  - tails-security-check: avoid generating double-slashes in the Atom
    feeds URL.
  - Remove "vga=788" boot parameter which breaks the boot on some hardware.
  - Remove now useless "splash" boot parameter.
  - Fix a bunch of i386-isms.
  - Pass the noswap option to the kernel. This does not change actual Tails
    behaviour but prevents users from unnecessarily worrying because of 
    the "Activating swap" boot message.
  - Make use of check.torproject.org's Arabic version.

  * Build system
  - Enable squeeze-backports. It is now ready and will be used soon.
  - Install eatmydata in the chroot.
  - Convert ikiwiki setup files to YAML.

  ** SNAPSHOT build @ef28782a0bf58004397b5fd303f938cc7d11ddaa **

  * Hardware support
  - Use a 2.6.32 kernel: linux-image-2.6.32-bpo.5-686 (2.6.32-23~bpo50+1)
    from backports.org. This should support far more hardware and
    especially a lot of wireless adapters.
  - Add firmware for RTL8192 wireless adapters.
  - Enable power management on all wireless interfaces on boot.

  * Software
  - Install inkscape.
  - Install poedit.
  - Install gfshare and ssss: two complementary implementations
    of Shamir's Secret Sharing.
  - Install tor-geoipdb.
  - Remove dialog, mc and xterm.

  * Iceweasel
  - Set extensions.torbutton.spoof_english to its default true value
    in order to workaround a security issue:
    https://amnesia.boum.org/security/Iceweasel_exposes_a_rare_User-Agent/

  * Monkeysphere
  - Install the Iceweasel extension.
  - Use a hkps:// keyserver.

  * GnuPG
  - Install gnupg from backports.org so that hkps:// is supported.
  - Use a hkps:// keyserver.
  - Proxy traffic via polipo.
  - Prefer up-to-date digests and ciphers.

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.10.

  * Build system
  - Built images are now named like this:
    tails-i386-lenny-0.5-20100925.iso
  - Use live-helper support for isohybrid options instead of doing the
    conversion ourselves. The default binary image type we build is now
    iso-hybrid.
  - Remove .deb built by m-a after they have been installed.
  - Setup custom GConf settings at build time rather than at boot time.
  - Move $HOME files to /etc/skel and let adduser deal with permissions.
  - Convert to live-boot / live-config / live-build 2.x branches.
  - Replaced our custom live-initramfs with a custom live-boot package;
    included version is 2.0.5-1+tails2.6797e8 from our Git repository:
    git clone git://git.immerda.ch/tails_live-boot.git
  - Install live-config* from the live-snapshots Lenny repository.
    Rationale: live-config binary packages differ depending on the target
    distribution, so that using Squeeze's live-config does not produce
    fully-working Lenny images.
  - Rename custom scripts, packages lists and syslinux menu entries from
    the amnesia-* namespace to the tails-* one.

  * HTP
  - Use (authenticated) HTP instead of NTP.
  - The htpdate script that is used comes from commit 43f5f83c0 in our
    custom repository:  git://git.immerda.ch/tails_htp.git
  - Start Tor and Vidalia only once HTP is done.

  * Misc
  - Fix IPv6 firewall restore file. It was previously not used at all.
  - Use ftp.us.debian.org instead of the buggy GeoIP-powered
    cdn.debian.net.
  - Gedit: don't autocreate backup copies.
  - Build images with syslinux>=4.01 that has better isohybrid support.
  - amnesia-security-check: got rid of the dependency on File::Slurp.
  - Take into account the migration of backports.org to backports.debian.org.
  - Make GnuPG key import errors fatal on boot.
  - Warn the user when T(A)ILS is running inside a virtual machine.
  - DNS cache: forget automapped .onion:s on Tor restart.

  * Documentation: imported Incognito's walkthrough, converted to
    Markdown, started the needed adaptation work.

tails (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The project has merged efforts with Incognito.
    It is now to be called "The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System".
    In short: T(A)ILS.

  * Community
  - Created the amnesia-news mailing-list.
  - Added a forum to the website.
  - Created a chatroom on IRC: #tails on irc.oftc.net

  * Fixed bugs
  - Workaround nasty NetworkManager vs. Tor bug that often
    prevented the system to connect to the Tor network: restart Tor and Vidalia
    when a network interface goes up.
  - onBoard now autodetects the keyboard layout... at least once some
    keys have been pressed.
  - New windows don't open in background anymore, thanks to
    a patched Metacity.
  - Memory wiping at shutdown is now lightning fast, and does not prevent
    the computer to halt anymore.
  - GNOME panel icons are right-aligned again.
  - Fixed permissions on APT config files.
  - Repaired mouse integration when running inside VirtualBox.

  * Iceweasel
  - Torbutton: redirect to Scroogle when presented a Google captcha.
  - Revamped bookmarks
      . moved T(A)ILS own website to the personal toolbar
      . moved webmail links (that are expected to be more than 3 soon)
        to a dedicated folder.
  - Don't show AdBlock Plus icon in the toolbar.
  - Adblock Plus: updated patterns, configured to only update subscriptions
    once a year. Which means never, hopefully, as users do update their
    Live system on a regular basis, don't they?

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.8.
  
  * Claws Mail
  - Install Claws Mail from backports.org to use the X.509 CA
    certificates provided by Debian.
  - Enable PGP modules with basic configuration:
      . Automatically check signatures.
      . Use gpg-agent to manage passwords.
      . Display warning on start-up if GnuPG doesn't work.
  - Set the IO timeout to 120s (i.e. the double of the default 60s).
  
  * Pidgin
  - Automatically connect to irc.oftc.net with a randomized nickname,
    so as not to advertize the use of T(A)ILS; this nickname is made of:
     . a random firstname picked from the 2000 most registered by the U.S.
       social security administration in the 70s;
     . two random digits.
    Good old irc.indymedia.org is still configured - with same nickname -
    but is not enabled by default anymore.
  - Disabled MSN support, that is far too often affected by security flaws.

  * Build $HOME programmatically
  - Migrated all GConf settings, including the GNOME panel configuration,
    to XML files that are loaded at boot time.
  - Configure iceweasel profile skeleton in /etc/iceweasel.
    A brand new profile is setup from this skeleton once iceweasel is
    started after boot.
      . build sqlite files at build time from plain SQL.
      . FireGPG: hard-code current firegpg version at build time to prevent
        the extension to think it was just updated.
      . stop shipping binary NSS files. These were here only to
        install CaCert's certificate, that is actually shipped by Debian's
        patched libnss.
  
  * Build system
  - Updated Debian Live snapshots APT repository URL.
  - Purge all devel packages at the end of the chroot configuration.
  - Make sure the hook that fixes permissions runs last.
  - Remove unwanted Iceweasel search plugins at build time.
  
  * Misc
  - Added a progress bar for boot time file readahead.
  - Readahead more (~37MB) stuff in foreground at boot time.
  - Make the APT pinning persist in the Live image.
  - localepurge: keep locales for all supported languages,
    don't bother when installing new packages.
  - Removed syslinux help menu: these help pages are either buggy or
    not understandable by non-geeks.
  - Fixed Windows autorun.
  - Disable a few live-initramfs scripts to improve boot time.
  - Firewall: forbid any IPv6 communication with the outside.
  - Virtualization support: install open-vm-tools.
  - WhisperBack: updated to 1.2.1, add a random bug ID to the sent
    mail subject.
  - Prompt for CD removal on shutdown, not for USB device.

  * live-initramfs: new package built from our Git (e2890a04ff) repository.
  - Merged upstream changes up to 1.177.2-1.
  - New noprompt=usb feature.
  - Fix buggy memory wiping and shutdown.
  - Really reboot when asked, rather than shutting down the system.

  * onBoard
  - Upgraded to a new custom, patched package (0.93.0-0ubuntu4~amnesia1).
  - Added an entry in the Applications menu.
  
  * Software
  - Install vim-nox with basic configuration
  - Install pwgen
  - Install monkeysphere and msva-perl
  - Replaced randomsound with haveged as an additional source of entropy.

  * Hardware support
  - Build ralink rt2570 wifi modules.
  - Build rt2860 wifi modules from Squeeze. This supports the RT2860
    wireless adapter, found particularly in the ASUS EeePC model 901
    and above.
  - Build broadcom-sta-source wifi modules.
  - Bugfix: cpufreq modules were not properly added to /etc/modules.
  - Use 800x600 mode on boot rather than 1024x768 for compatibility
    with smaller displays.

amnesia (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  New release, mainly aimed at fixing live-initramfs security issue
  (Debian bug #568750), with an additional set of small enhancements as
  a bonus.

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 8b96e5a6cf8abc)
  - based on new 1.173.1-1 upstream release
  - fixed live-media=removable behaviour so that filesystem images found
    on non-removable storage are really never used (Debian bug #568750)

  * Vidalia: bring back our UI customizations (0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1)

  * APT: consistently use the GeoIP-powered cdn.debian.net

  * Software: make room so that {alpha, future} Squeeze images fit on
    700MB CD-ROM
  - only install OpenOffice.org's calc, draw, impress, math and writer
    components
  - removed OpenOffice.org's English hyphenation and thesaurus
  - removed hunspell, wonder why it was ever added

  * Boot
  - explicitly disable persistence, better safe than sorry
  - removed compulsory 15s timeout, live-initramfs knows how to wait for
    the Live media to be ready

  * Build system: don't cache rootfs anymore

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 07 Feb 2010 18:28:16 +0100

amnesia (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag bugfix release: have amnesia-security-check use
    entries publication time, rather than update time... else tagging
    a security issue as fixed, after releasing a new version, make this
    issue be announced to every user of this new, fixed version.

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 06 Feb 2010 03:58:41 +0100

amnesia (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now only build and ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
    burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.

  * l10n: we now build and ship multilingual images; initially supported
    (or rather wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it,
    pt, es
  - install Iceweasel's and OpenOffice.org's l10n packages for every
    supported language
  - stop installing localized help for OpenOffice.org, we can't afford it
    for enough languages
  - when possible, Iceweasel's homepage and default search engine are localized
  - added Iceweasel's "any language" Scroogle SSL search engine
  - when the documentation icon is clicked, display the local wiki in
    currently used language, if available
  - the Nautilus wipe script is now translatable
  - added gnome-keyboard-applet to the Gnome panel

  * software
  - replaced Icedove with claws mail, in a bit rough way; see
    https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/replace_icedove_with_claws/ for best
    practices and configuration advices
  - virtual keyboard: install onBoard instead of kvkbd
  - Tor controller: install Vidalia instead of TorK
  - install only chosen parts of Gnome, rather than gnome-desktop-environment
  - do not install xdialog, which is unused and not in Squeeze
  - stop installing grub as it breaks Squeeze builds (see Debian bug #467620)
  - install live-helper from snapshots repository into the Live image

  * Iceweasel
  - do not install the NoScript extension anymore: it is not strictly
    necessary but bloodily annoying

  * Provide WhisperBack 1.2 for anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting.
  - added dependency on python-gnutls
  - install the SMTP hidden relay's certificate

  * amnesia-security-check: new program that tells users that the amnesia
    version they are running is affected by security flaws, and which ones
    they are; this program is run at Gnome session startup, after sleeping
    2 minutes to let Tor a chance to initialize.
    Technical details:
  - Perl
  - uses the Desktop Notifications framework
  - fetches the security atom feed from the wiki
  - verifies the server certificate against its known CA
  - tries fetching the localized feed; if it fails, fetch the default
    (English) feed

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 40e957c4b89099e06421)
  - at shutdown time, ask the user to unplug the CD / USB stick, then run
    smem, wait for it to finish, then attempt to immediately halt

  * build system
  - bumped dependency on live-helper to >= 2.0a6 and adapted our config
  - generate hybrid ISO images by default, when installed syslinux is
    recent enough
  - stop trying to support building several images in a row, it is still
    broken and less needed now that we ship hybrid ISO images
  - scripts/config: specify distribution when initializing defaults
  - updated Debian Live APT repository's signing key

  * PowerPC
  - disable virtualbox packages installing and module building on !i386
    && !amd64, as PowerPC is not a supported guest architecture
  - built and imported tor_0.2.1.20-1~~lenny+1_powerpc.deb

  * Squeeze
  - rough beginnings of a scratch Squeeze branch, currently unsupported
  - install gobby-infinote

  * misc
  - updated GnuPG key with up-to-date signatures
  - more improvements on boot time from CD
  - enhanced the wipe in Nautilus UI (now asks for confirmation and
    reports success or failure)
  - removed the "restart Tor" launcher from the Gnome panel

amnesia (0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
  http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
  Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
  remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
  * hardware support:
  - install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
  - install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
  - install aircrack-ng
  - install xserver-xorg-video-geode on i386 (eCafe support)
  - install xserver-xorg-video-all
  - install firmware-linux from backports.org
  - install system-config-printer
  - added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the Hercules eCAFE EC-800
    netbook
  * APT:
  - configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from
    squeeze; the APT source for testing is hardcoded in chroot_sources/,
    since there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR in chroot_local-hooks
  - give backports.org priority 200, so that we track upgrades of packages
    installed from there
  * release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
  in the   /usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
  * software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
  easily clone myself when running from CD
  * build system
  - build i386 images when the build host is amd64
  - added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
  - use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
  - setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
  - rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
    (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
  - stop "supporting" KDE
  - allow building several images at once
  - migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
  - append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
  - moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
    $AMNESIA_*
  * iceweasel
  - default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
    in French language; the English one is also installed
  - never ask to save passwords or forms content
  - configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
  - installed the CACert root certificate
  - installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
  - installed the FireGPG extension
  - installed the CS Lite extension
  - installed the NoScript extension
  - NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
    trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
  - configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
    user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
    user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
      about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
      about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
      about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
    user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
  - install the NoScript plugin from Debian squeeze
  - delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we disabled
    "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
  - torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze
  * linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
  * compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
    prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
  * software: added
  - gnome-app-install
  - iwconfig
  - cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
  - kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
  - sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
  - less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
  - scribus
  * Tor
  - enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
  - save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
    live user can use Tork and co.
  - autostart Tork with Gnome
  - Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
  - added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by Network Manager as well),
    so that Tor does work immediately even if the network cable was
    plugged late in/after the boot process
  * $HOME
  - added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
  - bash with working completion for the live user
  * polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
  through Tor
  * DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
  the Tor resolver
  * firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
  transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
  * misc
  - set syslinux timeout to 4 seconds
  - use splashy for more user-friendly boot/halt sequences
