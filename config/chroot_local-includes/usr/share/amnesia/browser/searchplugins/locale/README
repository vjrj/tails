When Tails is built, the searchplugins defined in these directories
will be symlinked to the corresponding locale directory in
/usr/local/lib/tor-browser/distribution/searchplugins/locale with
one twist: if a language has more than one locale, the searchplugins
will be symlinked in all the corresponding directories.
