"If you want to login to a captive portal to get Internet access (as is "
"commonly necessary at Internet cafés, libraries, schools and other public "
"places and businesses), try visiting any web site you know of by entering "
"its address in the address field above. The web site you choose should "
"preferably be common to your geographic location in order to raise less "
"suspicion (good examples of such pages are search engines, news papers' home "
"pages and similar). Once you've done that you should be redirected to the "
"login page instead, and once logged in you should have Internet access so "
"that you can start your anonymous activity by using **other** applications "
"than the Unsafe Browser."
