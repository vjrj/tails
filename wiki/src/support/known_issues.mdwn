Problems starting Tails
=======================

This section lists known problems with specific hardware. To report a problem
with different hardware see our [[report guidelines when Tails does not
start|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start]].

Acer Chromebook C720
--------------------

Booting fails with `Not enough memory to load specified image`. Work around by
adding the `mem=1500m` [[boot
option|/doc/first_steps/startup_options/#boot_menu]].

Acer Travelmate 8573T-254G50M
-----------------------------

Does not start on USB sticks created using Tails Installer.
Booting from DVD works fine.

Mac
---

For the moment, Tails has a very limited support for Mac.

Most recent Mac boot with UEFI only, and currently
Tails does not start with UEFI. See [[the corresponding blueprint|blueprint/UEFI]].

See also [[manual installation using
Mac|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/mac]] for more compatibility
reports.

ASUS VivoBook X202E
-------------------

Legacy support needs to be enabled in order to start Tails. To enable
legacy boot support, enable 'Launch CSM' under boot (menu).

Compaq 615
----------

You need to update the firmware to its latest version in order to start from a
device installed using Tails Installer.

Dell Inc. Latitude E6430/0CPWYR
-------------------------------

Does not start on USB sticks created using Tails Installer.

With BIOS versions A03 06/03/2012 (and A09 and A11)

Error message: `Invalid partition table!`

Workaround (at least with BIOS versions A09 and A11): just hit enter
and it will continue with the boot.

Dell XPS L702X/03RG89, Samsung RV520, Samsung Series 7 Chronos
--------------------------------------------------------------

Does not start on USB sticks created using Tails Installer.

We were reported that the legacy BIOS shipped on these systems doesn't
know how to deal with the GPT partition scheme installed by Tails
Installer.

<http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19392884/20010995.aspx>

Dell Inspiron 8100
------------------

The display panel will have the wrong resolution unless `video=LVDS-1:1600x1200
nouveau.noaccel=1` is added to the boot command line.

Dell Dimension 2400
-------------------

Cannot start neither from USB nor from DVD. System crashes with a blank
screen and locked up keyboard.

Clevo W258CU, ThinkPad X121e, X220, X230, T420i, T430, T410, T520, W520, T530, E325 and E530
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These machines do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB
Installer, due to a firmware limitation.

A workaround for some of these machines is to use the [[manual
installation process|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/linux]].
Note, however, that this technique does not allow you to set up
a persistent volume.

Lenovo Thinkcentre M82
----------------------

Even configured to boot in "legacy" mode, they fail to start Tails; with BIOS
9SKT58AUS and also 9SKT79AUS.

USB sticks installed using Tails Installer results in a blinking white cursor in
the upper left-hand corner, before even seeing the syslinux screen.

USB stick installed manually results in repeated reboots with a very brief flash
of something that says "machine check error".

Toshiba Satellite C50-A-12K and C855D-S5106
-------------------------------------------

Fails to start from a Tails USB unless forced to boot using CSM, and not UEFI,
first, as advised on:

Problematic USB sticks
----------------------

The following USB sticks have issues starting Tails.  They are configured by the
manufacturer as a fixed disk, and not as a removable disk. As a consequence,
they require removing the `live-media=removable` boot parameter, which [[is
dangerous|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start#entirely]].

* SanDisk Cruzer Edge 8GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Extreme USB 3.0 16GB and 32GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Fit USB 2.0 8GB, 16GB, and 32G
* SanDisk Cruzer Force 8GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Glide 4GB, 8GB and 16GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Switch USB 2.0 8GB and 32GB
* SanDisk Cruzer USB 3.0 64GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Blade 4GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Facet
* Staples Relay USB 2.0 16GB

SanDisk had begun the production of flash drives configured as fixed disk in
2012 to meet new requirements for Windows 8 Certification. The flash drives that
comply with this certification will have the Windows 8 logo on their packaging.
If a flash drive does not have the Windows 8 logo on its packaging, then that
drive will function as a removable disk about should work with Tails.

Chainloading Tails from GRUB
----------------------------

To workaround problems in booting Tails on laptops with UEFI support, it is
possible to chainload the syslinux on the ISO image from another boot loader
that is already working on the laptop, like GRUB. Be careful not to modify at
all the options of syslinux in the process.

The following commands, run from the GRUB shell, might be helpful:

    set root=(hd1)
    chainloader +1
    boot

Security issues
===============

Tails might not erase all the system memory on shutdown
-------------------------------------------------------

On rare systems (non-PAE with big amounts of memory),
Tails does not consistently [[!tails_todo
more_efficient_memory_wipe desc="erase all system memory as it
should"]].

After using Tails Installer, the "emergency shutdown" doesn't work
------------------------------------------------------------------

Tails Installer messes a bit too much with the USB devices for the
"emergency shutdown on media removal" feature to continue working after using
it. If you believe this feature is critical for the session you're running, we
advice you to reboot Tails.

Tails DVD eject failure
-----------------------

Pressing the DVD eject button does not trigger emergency shutdown.
Also, the "normal" (non-emergency) shutdown procedure does not eject
the DVD anymore.

(Ticket: [[!tails_todo fix_DVD_eject_at_shutdown]])

Stream isolation inconsistency in Claws Mail
--------------------------------------------

Claws Mail isn't using its dedicated Tor SocksPort for Tor hidden
service IMAP/POP/SMTP servers (instead Tor's TransPort is used). This
is just a deviation from Tails' design and should have no adverse real
world consequences.

Tails fails to completely shutdown or restart
---------------------------------------------

When stopping Tails on some hardware, the memory wipe procedure fails to
complete: the display gets scrambled, but the computer doesn't
completely shutdown or restart. Sometimes the caps-lock button light of
the keyboard flashes.

<div class="caution">

When this happens, there is no guarantee that the memory is wiped entirely.

</div>

This issue has been reported on the following hardware:

  - Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion dv6 Notebook PC
  - Lenovo ThinkPad X61, only on emergency shutdown when pulling out the
    USB stick
  - Toshiba Satellite C855D
  - Dell Inc. Studio 1458
  - Fujitsu Lifebook AH531/GFO, only on regular shutdown, emergency
    shutdown works

Fingerprint
===========

<!-- If this section is empty adjust the [[fingerprint documentation|doc/about/fingerprint]]. -->

<!-- The fingerprints of the Tor browser and the TBB are different: -->

* Browser window resizing is in not reliable: [[!tails_ticket 6377]]
  and [[!tor_bug 10095]].

Other issues
============

Connecting to FTP servers is not possible
-----------------------------------------

Public FTP servers on the Internet are not reachable using Tails.
See [[!tails_todo fix_Internet_FTP_support desc="the corresponding
task"]] for more details.

YouTube videos are hard to get
------------------------------

[[!tails_todo easier_YouTube desc="HTML5 video are not easily seen on YouTube"]]. When the
message *This video is currently unavailable* appears, the video can actually be viewed.
Right-click on the page, select **NoScript** → **Blocked objects** and
**Temporarily allow…** the video.

Tails will never support videos which require Flash (those with ads).

"Connect automatically" for NetworkManager connections isn't persistent
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When the "Network Connections" persistence feature is
activated, the "Connect automatically" setting isn't saved for any
connection.  While this is a bug, it's actually a good
one. NetworkManager itself enables this option by default for all new
connections, and could result in users re-connecting to a previous network at
times when they don't want that.

Tails fails to connect to certain Wi-Fi networks
------------------------------------------------

This might be related to the introduction of wireless regulation support
in Tails 0.13.

Tails could behave better when run inside VirtualBox
----------------------------------------------------

Since 0.17.1, VirtualBox guest modules are not shipped anymore.

See [[!tails_todo fix_virtualbox_guest_modules_build desc="the
corresponding task"]] for details.

Touchpad configurations
-----------------------

### Acer TravelMate B113 - ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad

    synclient FingerPress=256;
    synclient TapButton3=0;
    synclient Clickpad=1;
    synclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1;
    synclient FingerLow=1;
    synclient FingerHigh=1;

TorBrowser takes too long to shutdown
-------------------------------------

Since Tails 0.22, the browser sometimes takes too long to shutdown
([[!tails_ticket 6480]]). Waiting a few more seconds is usually enough
to let it close itself correctly.
