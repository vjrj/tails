IIRC, both leaks do not appear when using a version of Firefox built with Mike Perry's patches. The [[issue is on our radar|todo/replace iceweasel with Torbrowser]] but it is not an easy one to tackle properly.

Two things about those leaks, though:

 * Not having a memory cache gets browsing through Tor even slower than it already is. Tails being amnesic, the memory cache does not survive long. Using the *New identity* option in the browser menu will clear it. Closing Iceweasel will clear it. Shuting down Tails will clear it.
 * Regarding fonts, every Tails user gets the same set (except those who have been badly playing with persistence). Given there are many people using Tails, this already is a decent anonymity set.
