I managed to get proxychains working:

I `sudo apt-get install proxychains lynx` then copy /etc/proxychains.conf to my ~/Persistent/ dir and comment out the `proxy_dns` line. Then to use proxychains with lynx we need to clear all proxy-related env variables (ones that contain 8118). See `set | grep 8118` for a list, `http_proxy=` etc blank them.

Once that's done you can `proxychains lynx http://check.torproject.org/`, if you get a congratulationary message you are okay to open the config file, add a proxy to the end of the file and try again. If that's good (doesn't detect Tor) then you can uncomment the `#quiet_mode` line so you don't get dirt on your screen while surfing in text mode.

My next task will be to get a graphical mode browser working, I'm thinking netsurf but apt appears to be broken so I can't install it.
