> When copying files from an encrypted drive to an unecrypted one, will any data BEYOND what was intended to be copied then remain on the unencrypted drive?

I don't see what additional data would be copied if you use `cp`. Graphical file managers may want to do clever additional stuff (hint: thumbnails), but in the specific case you're describing, I guess Nautilus should be safe.
