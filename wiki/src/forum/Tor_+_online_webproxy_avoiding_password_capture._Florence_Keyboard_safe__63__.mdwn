To avoid being blocked on Tor-blocking websites, I sometimes use online webproxies in Iceweasel in Tails.

I have a few questions regarding the risk that data can be intercepted when using these proxies after Tor:

1. 
When I use a SSL-webproxy, and when logging into an account that has also SSL-security, will the webproxy be able to capture my password easily when I use TAILS'S FLORENCE VIRTUAL KEYBOARD? With easily I mean logging credentials by the proxy without an explicit attack on my account/dataflow. 

2. 
And what about for the same as above, but using a webproxy without SSL. Can passwords still be captured by the webproxy when using the Florence Keyboard? 

3. 
And what about copying and pasting a password into the field while logging on with the scenario in point 1. Will the password also be captured by the proxy or is the Florence Virtual Keyboard safer?


I hope to get real educated suggestions on this.

Many thanks in advance!
