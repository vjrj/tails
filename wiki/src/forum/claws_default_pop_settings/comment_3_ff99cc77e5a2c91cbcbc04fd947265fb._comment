Hi again. I eventually could agree: if the beast *did* behave as you
are trying to guess, this setting would need to be changed indeed.

But it does *not*. At least, not in my experienced. Have you actually
reproduced the described behavior or are you guessing about the \"boils
down to the same\" thing?

I just tested this. Claws Mail did not delete email that was older
than 7-days from the INBOX on the server. I guess it *would* delete
*all* email I fetched today *if I run the same Claws Mail
configuration next week*, which is unlikely and currently not
supported as there is no [[todo/persistence]] support yet.
