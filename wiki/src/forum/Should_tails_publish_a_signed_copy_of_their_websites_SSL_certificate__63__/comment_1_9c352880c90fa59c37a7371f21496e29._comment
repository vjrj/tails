The goal of [monkeysphere](http://web.monkeysphere.info/) (also see our [[todo item|todo/monkeysphere]]) is to introduce the OpenPGP Web-of-Trust into the authentifocation process of certificates used in web browsing, among other protocols. You should have a look into it, because it does what you describe, but in an automated way.

The method you describe is IMHO a bit too ad-hoc. If people don't use monkeysphere (which pretty much is the case) I cannot see why people would want to use this even more awkward method.
