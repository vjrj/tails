Alright, I am following a method to work around the fact that in tails 0.9 you can only download 64MB. I want some feedback on this very soon and I'm not having any luck where it was posted originally.

I'm doing that method to download tails 0.10. I'm not that familar with unix commands (or even linux systems) so I ran into some issues. When I enter the sudo vim /etc/polipo/config command, the file appears in the termainal and prompts me with the options of read-only, edit anyway, etc. I press e for edit anyway and change the chunkHighMark value to 700,000,000. How do I save or overwrite the file? I tried :q and :q!
