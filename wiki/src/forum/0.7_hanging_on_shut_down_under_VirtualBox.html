Hello and thank you for such a interesting tool.<br><br>

I tried the latest release (0.7) under Oracle Virtual Box (both the latest version 4.0.4 and an earlier version) and have found that it consistently hangs at:

<tt>[   4.100093] [<c10031dc>] ? syscall_call+0x7/0xb</tt>

<br>Anyone else have this issue?  Any known work-around?  Thank you.
