Hi, 
I thought it would be usefull to have the possibility to use virtual keyboard when it is required to enter the password for persistence.
I haven't found this possibility.
So now it is better to use encrypted usb key so that the password is not enter with the keyboard.
It is just a small suggestion, but you are doing a great job !
