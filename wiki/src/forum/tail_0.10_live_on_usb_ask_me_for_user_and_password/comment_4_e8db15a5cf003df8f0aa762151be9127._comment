again....

for all with the same idea.... :-) 
i have a multibiitstick with grub4dos. I make a folder named incognito and put all files from the iso in. that are filesystem.packages ; filesystem.squashfs ; initrd.img and vmlinuz . 
the menu.lst from grub looks like : 
title Incognito
  root (hd0,0)
  kernel /incognito/vmlinuz live-media-path=/incognito/ toram=filesystem.squashfs lang=us boot=live noeject noprompt keyboard=us
  initrd /incognito/initrd.img

maybe have anybody a better solution
