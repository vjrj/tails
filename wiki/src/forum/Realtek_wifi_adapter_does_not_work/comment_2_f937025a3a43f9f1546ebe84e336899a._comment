RTL8192 and RTL8192se are different hardware, and need different
firmware and drivers to work.

[[!debbug 609784]] and [[!debbug 590280]] allow tracking progress of
efforts being made to have Debian support the RTL8192se wireless
interface. See also the [upstream kernel bug
report](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29532).

[A Ubuntu
bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/401126)
shows people using the driver provided by Realtek have various results.
