Whonix has different goals and use cases than Tails.

Developers of Whonix and Tails already exchange ideas, code and documentation; look at the tails-dev mailing-list archives.

Otherwise, this is a forum about Tails. If you are interested to talk about Whonix, please do so on appropriate channels.
