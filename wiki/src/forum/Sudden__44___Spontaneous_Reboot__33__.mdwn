[Apparently SOLVED- see followup posts]

Yesterday, a strange and alarming thing happened to me while running the just-released Tails 0.14. I was working with Nautilus, organizing files on a LUKS volume, while Iceweasel was loading a graphic-heavy web page. All of a sudden, my screen went completely black, with nothing but a flashing bar-cursor. This lasted for several seconds, after which the round, spinning cursor, followed by the "Tails Greeter" appeared. Tails then completed the booting process (seemingly as normal), which itself is odd to me-- considering that there was no boot-medium present: I had removed the USB stick right after I had initially booted, since I had used the `toram` option.

If I had merely run out of RAM, wouldn't TAILS simply *freeze*? How could it just automatically, spontaneously *reboot* like that-- especially when there was no boot-medium present?!

Let me note the following:

- the computer this happened with has 2 GB of RAM

- This was my first time using the `toram` option at boot

- After experiencing the spontaneous reboot that I described above, I manually rebooted from scratch (again using the `toram` option) and did not experience anything unusual.  

Might the seemingly spontaneous reboot that I experienced have been the result of a remote intrusion?
