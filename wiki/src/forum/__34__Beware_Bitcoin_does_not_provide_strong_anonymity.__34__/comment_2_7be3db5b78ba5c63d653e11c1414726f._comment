Most users won't have mined all their own BTCs, but got them from sources that have real world connections to their persons. Worst (and possibly most common) case: someone bought BTC on a Bitcoin exchange using his or her credit card. Even if s/he used Tor, the Bitcoin exchange knows who bought BTCs and due to the public nature of *all* BTC transactions the exchange also knows exactly what happened to them. For strong anonymity no one except the holder of the BTCs should have all that information.

Sure, there may be ellaborate BTC laundry schemes or the possibility to buy BTCs with cash from some Bitcoin exchanges etc. which may end up with something akin to strong anonymity, but trying to convey that in a (by neccessity) short warning is likely to only confuse. The warning message as it is right now is true enough, and will make people that think Bitcoins are magically anonymous think twice.
