1.) In the LWN.net review of Tails, it says: ( https://lwn.net/Articles/440279/ )

"Tails gets its security updates from Debian's repositories, but the live CD doesn't automatically download updates nor alert the user to download them. So a manual

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

before each use of the live CD is needed to stay on the safe side, because the distribution doesn't support persistent storage. Of course users could also download a new ISO image from time to time, but that seems like a waste of bandwidth."

I would like to know what the developers of Tails think of this. 

Would it be sufficient to run the apt-get update and upgrade commands each time I boot into 0.7 or do you recommend downloading the newest ISO ? 

2.) How concerned do you think I should be about having used 0.7 (without updating) for several hours yesterday?

I occasionally got the warning about using an external application while browsing certain Tor hidden sites. This alarmed me because these appeared to be ordinary http pages and I had browsed them in the past using the exact same Tails 0.7 CD and did not receive any such warnings.    

Thank you to everyone involved in this project. It is quite impressive and much appreciated.
