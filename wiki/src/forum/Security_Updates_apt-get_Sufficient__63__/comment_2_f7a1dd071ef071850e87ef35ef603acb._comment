About upgrading with APT: there are possibilities one messes up her anonymity and/or privacy while doing so:

1. If dpkg asks if it should replace a configuration file *and* the
   user answers *Yes*, there are chances Tails will not function as it
   should and may not provide the intended protection.
2. It may install a new version of some bundled software that is not
   covered by Tails configuration. Consequences can be basically
   whatever.

=> I would not generally recommend the casual Tails user to upgrade
her system without deeply understanding APT, Debian systems, the
possible consequences and probably how Tails works in details.
