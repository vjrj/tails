1) Just running an apt-get update && upgrade is better than nothing, but won't replace a real upgrade by downloading the new iso. Mainly because some of the upgrades you do with apt-get might require a reboot to be effective, which doesn't happen in the Tails' context. You also won't be able to use the new features we put in our releases, nor their bug fixes, which aren't always available in the Debian archive.

2) Not sure how concerned you should be, depends on the usage you did. We usually advice not to run a session that long, because it typically means that you are using several of your identities in a single session, which might help an attacker to correlate them. You should rather reboot each time you want to use a new identity, or work on a new task.

The warning is normal (is a Torbutton feature) and usually happens when you try to see documents that are not readable by your browser and needs an external application (i.e a pdf). Check that the page you are willing to see is really html.
