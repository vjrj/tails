If possible, I wanted to suggest considering a lightweight distribution based on something like Xfce, openbox, or similarly efficient desktops. Gnome cab be a little hefty for some older systems. (especially with little RAM) Maybe a distribution could be built on top of Debian Live Xfce.

Thanks for your time!
