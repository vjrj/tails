ii  spice-vdagent


0.10.1-1 Spice agent for Linux

===============

# spice-vdagent ?? Really? Why?

via man page it gives this link:

http://www.spice-space.org/documentation.html

It appears to be some kind of remote server or service. Why is it included?

Is it safe to remove or is it tied to Tails function?
