If the encrypted drive is mounted at any time while the computer is running, it seems that currently few if any utilities are able to wipe the key material from RAM when it is unmounted.  This appears to mean that if the computer is infected with state-sponsored malware after the drive has been unmounted but before the computer is rebooted, a sophisticated remote attacker could learn enough information to later mount the encrypted drive if he either comes into physical possession of it, or even if he remotely intrudes into the target computer.

Consider a scenario in which a whistleblower with knowledge of illegal activities in some government organization or corporation does this:

* mount an encrypted drive while Tails is disconnected from internet
* read a file into RAM
* unmount the drive
* connect to internet
* use Tails browser to upload the file to a whistleblower site

Unfortunately, it seems possible that in this scenario the encryption keys for the encrypted drive could still reside in RAM, and if the would-be-whistleblower is subjected to a MITM attack (possibly using a stolen or improperly issued certificate) it seems that at least one widely deployed state-sponsored-malware can steal the key information from the RAM in a running computer.

Someone mentioned in another thread that he/she uses Tails but keeps it running continuously.  This would seem to risk a similar danger.
