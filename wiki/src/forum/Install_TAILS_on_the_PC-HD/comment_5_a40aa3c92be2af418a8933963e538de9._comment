This walkthrough was gold-dust for me, and I now have a working persistent TAILS install within VMWare. A couple of minor errors I found along the way:

On the line where the 'amnesia' user is added, a reference is made to the 'devian-tor' user group. I assume this is meant to be 'debian-tor'.

When 'fixing some symlinks', /usr/bin/Xorg cannot be linked to /etc/X11/X because the latter already exists. I have ignored the error without visible problems.

Also, the grub setup refers to an old version of grub. Presumably this walkthrough refers to an older version of TAILS than mine (0.6.2) - either way, there were lots of differences here.

I NEEDED to \"apt-get update\" before grub was even recognised as an installable package.

When installing grub (during initial configuration), grub presented me with a blank 'linux command line' which it apparently lifted from (nonexistent) 'grub.cfg' I think. I left it blank and moved on.

The sed command to edit /boot/grub/grub.lst did not work (didn't like the expression used with s option). There's no way it could have worked anyway, because my newer version of grub doesn't use grub.lst (or kopt). So again I ignored that bit.

I hope this comments are as useful to somebody else, as this page was to me.
