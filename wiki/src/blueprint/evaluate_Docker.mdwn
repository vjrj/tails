Availability on target platforms
================================

(as of 20150120)

Primary target platforms:

* Debian Wheezy: no, even in backports; installation is [possible
  using ugly methods](https://docs.docker.com/installation/debian/)
* Debian Jessie: 1.3.3~dfsg1-2
* Debian sid: 1.3.3~dfsg1-2
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 0.9.1, with 1.0.1 available in trusty-updates
* Ubuntu 14.10: 1.2.0

Bonus:

Random notes
============

* Since Docker 0.9, the default execution environment is libcontainer,
  instead of LXC. It now supports e.g. systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc,
  libvirt-sandbox, qemu/kvm, in addition to LXC.
* Docker seems to support sharing a directory between the host and
  a container, so on this front, we would not lose anything compared
  to Vagrant.
* Docker supports Linux and OSX.
* According to
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17989306/what-does-docker-add-to-just-plain-lxc>,
  Docker comes with tools to automatically build a container from
  source, version it, and upgrade it incrementally.
* Michael Prokop [gives
  pointers](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2014/07/23/book-review-the-docker-book/)
  about Docker integration with Jenkins.
* As far as our build system is concerned, we don't care much to
  protect the host system from the build container. The main goal is
  to produce a reliable build environment.
* For security info about Linux containers in general, see the
  [[dedicated blueprint|blueprint/Linux_containers]].
* [overclockix](https://github.com/mbentley/overclockix) uses
  live-build and provides a Dockerfile for easier building.
* Regarding API stability and backwards-compatibility:
  - "all [Docker] containers are backwards compatible, pretty much to
     the first version. [...] In general backwards compatibility is a
     big deal in the Docker project"
     ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7985142), shykes
     is a Docker developer)
  - Apparently the Docker 1.0 release broke older stuff, see e.g. the
    0.6 release in
    [the jenkins plugin changelog](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin).
