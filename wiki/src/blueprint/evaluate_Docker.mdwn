For the detailed plans and things to evaluate in Docker, see [[!tails_ticket 7530]].

Random notes:

* Since Docker 0.9, the default execution environment is libcontainer,
  instead of LXC. It now supports e.g. systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc,
  libvirt-sandbox, qemu/kvm, in addition to LXC.
* Docker seems to support sharing a directory between the host and
  a container, so on this front, we would not lose anything compared
  to Vagrant.
* Docker supports Linux and OSX.
* According to
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17989306/what-does-docker-add-to-just-plain-lxc>,
  Docker comes with tools to automatically build a container from
  source, version it, and upgrade it incrementally.
