[[!meta title="Scenarios for Tails Installer"]]

Improvements
------------

- Remove the splash screen:
  - Outside of Tails
  - In Tails, if we add a "Clone" button to the main interface
- Implement "Install from ISO".
- Autodetect if the destination key has Tails already.
  - Then display "Install" and "Upgrade" buttons accordingly.
- Make it possible to do "Install from ISO" and "Upgrade from ISO" from
  the command line.
- Rework wordings on main interface.
- Add visual and textual context to main interface.
- Point to website to download ISO if outside of Tails.
- Add second button "Upgrade" below or side-by-side with "Install"
  button.
- Add a splash about creating persistence after rebooting.

Bonus:

- Store version of Tails on destination key after install and upgrade.
  - This would allow to display version in "Target Device".

Upgrade scenarios
-----------------

The following diagram shows all possible upgrade scenarios given a
running Tails (origin), an ISO image, and a destination Tails.

[[!img upgrade_scenarios.png]]

- **Upgrade from ISO** and **Clone** are what we already have.
- **Hot upgrade** should be the ideal scenario for full upgrades, that
  would then be conducted like IUK.
- **Hot clone** could be a fallback scenario for full upgrades in case
  you can't download a full ISO. Still, as any clone operation, this
  introduces the possibility of cross contamination between Tails keys
  and should be discouraged in favor of hot upgrade.
