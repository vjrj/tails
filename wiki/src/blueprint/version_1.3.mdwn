## Major changes

  - Install the [[*Electrum* bitcoin client|doc/anonymous_internet/electrum]].
    You can save its configuration using the
    **[[Bitcoin Client|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#bitcoin]]**
    persistence feature.

  - To protect the system and your data from some types of attack
    against the browser, *Tor Browser* is now confined using *AppArmor*.

    As a consequence, it can only read and write to a limited number of
    folders. [[Learn more|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]]
    about how to manipulate files with *Tor Browser* from now on.

  - If you are using [[Tor bridges|doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]],
    you can now use **obfs4** bridges.

  - If you used to follow our instructions for manually installing onto a
    USB stick or SD card using
    [[Linux|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/linux]] or
    [[Mac OS&nbsp;X|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/mac]], you don't
    need to run `isohybrid` anymore. This will hopefully make Tails
    easier to install for Mac users.

    Please report any new problem if you are used to burn Tails on DVD.

## Minor improvements

  - Touchpad: enable tap-to-click, 2-fingers scrolling, and disable
    while typing. ([[!tails_ticket 7779]])
  - Support Vietnamese input in IBus. ([[!tails_ticket 7999]])
  - Improve support for OpenPGP smartcards. ([[!tails_ticket 6241]])
  - Install keyringer from Debian Jessie. ([[!tails_ticket 7752]])
  - Install GnuPG v2 and associated tools from wheezy-backports,
    primarily for its improved support for OpenPGP smartcards. It
    lives side-by-side with GnuPG v1, which still is the
    default. ([[!tails_ticket 6241]])
  - Darker background color to spare the users eyes. ([[!tails_ticket 7963]])
