    to persist their wallet. ([[!tails_ticket 6739]])
  - Distribute a hybrid ISO image again: no need for anyone to
    manually run `isohybrid` anymore! ([[!tails_ticket 8510]])
  - Confine the Tor Browser using AppArmor to protect against some
    types of attack. [Learn more](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/wiki/src/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser.mdwn?h=testing)
    about how this will affect your usage of Tails.
