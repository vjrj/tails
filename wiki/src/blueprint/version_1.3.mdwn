## New features

  - **Electrum Bitcoin** is an easy to use Bitcoin wallet provided as an optional installation. You can manually install Electrum Bitcoin with the [Installing Electrum Bitcoin procedure](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?page=doc%2Fanonymous_internet%2Felectrum&from=blueprint%2Fversion_1.3&do=create.).

  - Tor Bridges now support the **obfs4** pluggable transport. Pluggable transports transform the Tor traffic  between the client and the bridge. The obfs4 pluggable transport provides an additional pluggable transport to help disguise Tor traffic from censors.

  - The **Keyringer program** is an optional installation. Keyringer lets you manage and share secrets. You can manually install Keyringer with the [Installing Keyringer procedure](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?page=doc%2Fencryption_and_privacy%2Fkeyringer&from=blueprint%2Fversion_1.3&do=create). 

## Upgrades and changes

  - The **Tor Browser** has additional operating system and data **security**. This security restricts reads and writes to a limited number of folders.  [Learn more](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html#confinement) about how to manipulate files with the Tor Browser. 
  - The **Ibus Vietnamese input method** is now supported. 
  - The **maximum key-size for OpenPGP smartcards** is increased from 3072- to 4096-bits for better smartcard security.
  - The **Mac and Linux installation** processes no longer require the isohybrid command. Removing the isohybrid command simplifies the installation. 
  - The **tap-to-click** and **two-finger scrolling** trackpad settings are now enabled by default. This should be more intuitive for Mac users.
