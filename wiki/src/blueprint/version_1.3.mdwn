## Major changes

  - Install the [[*Electrum* bitcoin client|doc/anonymous_internet/electrum]].
    You can save its configuration using the
    **[[Bitcoin Client|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#bitcoin]]**
    persistence feature.

  - To protect the system and your data from some types of attack
    against the browser, *Tor Browser* is now confined using *AppArmor*.

    As a consequence, it can only read and write to a limited number of
    folders. [[Learn more|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]]
    about how to manipulate files with *Tor Browser* from now on.

  - If you are using [[Tor bridges|doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]],
    you can now use **obfs4** bridges.

  - If you used to follow our instructions for manually installing onto a
    USB stick or SD card using
    [[Linux|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/linux]] or
    [[Mac OS&nbsp;X|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/mac]], you don't
    need to run `isohybrid` anymore. This will hopefully make Tails
    easier to install for Mac users.

    Please report any new problem if you are used to burn Tails on DVD.

## Minor improvements

  - Touchpads have enable tap-to-click, 2-fingers scrolling enabled by
    default and are disabled while typing.
  - Darker background color to spare the users eyes.
  - Support Vietnamese input in IBus.
  - Install [[*keyringer*|doc/encryption_and_privacy/keyringer]], an
    encrypted and distributed secret sharing software.
  - Improve support for OpenPGP smartcards through the installation of
    *GnuPG* 2.
