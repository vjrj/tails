[[!meta title="Tails report from August to December 2014"]]

As you might have noticed, [[the last monthly report|news/report_2014_06-07]] was a long time ago, because the people who were doing them had really no time left. Somebody new finally takes over, let's hope it lasts :)

So, here is a minimal report for the second half of 2014, the next ones will be more complete.

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.1.1 was released on September 2, 2014.|news/version_1.1.1]] (minor release)
* [[Tails 1.2 was released on October 14, 2014.|news/version_1.2]] (major release)
* [[Tails 1.2.1 was released on December 3, 2014.|news/version_1.2.1]] (minor release)
* [[Tails 1.2.2 was released on December 15, 2014.|news/version_1.2.2]] (special minor release for security reasons)

Code
====

For details, see each release announce. Notable changes include:

* 1.1.1: [[I2P|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p]] now needs to be enabled with a boot option. We made this choice after [[a security hole affected I2P|security/Security_hole_in_I2P_0.9.13]] ; this problem is now fixed, but if any other is discovered in the future, it won't affect Tails users who don't use I2P.

* 1.2: [[Tor Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser]] replaces the previous Firefox + Torbutton setup. Several major applications are [[confined with AppArmor|contribute/design/application_isolation]].
* 1.2.1: finally remove [[TrueCrypt|doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt]].

Outreach
========

Some of Tails contributors were present in Hamburg during the [31C3](https://events.ccc.de/category/31c3/), and we held a Tails table where many people came to ask questions, get a Tails installed, start to contribute or just say thank you. We even had some origami folding moments :)

Press & Testimonials
====================

For more information concerning the second half of 2014, see [[our press page|press]].

* 2014-12-29: In [Reconstructive narratives](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6258_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412282030_-_reconstructing_narratives_-_jacob_-_laura_poitras.html#video) at the 31th Chaos Communication Congress, Jacob Appelbaum and Laura Poitras explained that properly implemented encryption technologies such as Tor, Tails, GnuPG, OTR, and RedPhone are some of the only ones that can blind the pervasive surveillance of the NSA. They are rated as "catastrophic" by the NSA itself.
* Tails is being used in the film [Citizenfour](https://citizenfourfilm.com/) by Laura Poitras and appears in the credits.
