* HTML5 audio playback
* WebM video and audio playback
* download to amnesiac `~/Tor Browser`
* read from amnesiac `~/Tor Browser`
* default upload directory is `~/Tor Browser/`
* `~/Tor Browser/` must always exist
* there must always be a GTK bookmark to `~/Tor Browser/`

  `~/Persistent/Tor Browser` must exist and there must be
  a GNOME bookmark pointing to it

## manual test OK

(needs to be tested again with current status of the branch at some point)

* add NoScript exception
* change stuff in about:prefs
* manually update AdBlock Plus lists
* add a bookmark, with persistent bookmarks feature enabled, in
  read-only persistence mode
* install a Firefox add-on (this does not mean we actively support that, right? :)
* read from persistent `~/Persistent/Tor Browser`, in read-only
  persistence mode

## manual test OK, maybe needs automated test


## known issues


## needs testing

* printing to real printer

User experience matters
=======================

Until the `feature/5525-sandbox-web-browser` branch is merged, see the
"User experience matters" section on
<https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/tree/wiki/src/contribute/design/application_isolation.mdwn?h=feature/5525-sandbox-web-browser>.

Later, see [[contribute/design/application_isolation#ux]].

Remaining questions:

1. What to do about alternative browsers (I2P and Unsafe Browser)?
   We have [[!tails_ticket 8280 desc="a ticket"]] about allowing the
   I2P Browser to access local files. Shall we use e.g. `~/Tor Browser
   files/`, `~/I2P Browser files/` and `~/Unsafe Brower files/` (the
   latter may make sense now that we plan to move the LAN browsing
   support into the Unsafe Browser) â€” and equivalently,
   `~/Persistent/Tor Browser/`, etc.? or rather a single
   shared namespace, with e.g. `~/Browser files/Tor Browser`,
   `~/Browser files/I2P Browser`, etc.?
   
   In any case, of course we should _not_ allow a given browser to
   access files in other browsers' own download directory (this would
   be too much of a linkability and de-anonymization risk)

2. The "New Identity" problem. The Tor Browser tries hard to prevent
   data to persist once its "New Identity" button has been clicked, to
   prevent activities performed before and after this action to be
   linked with each other. As boyska (a Freepto developer) made me
   realize while we were discussing these problems, by introducing
   a persistent downloads directory, we somewhat break this design
   goal. Of course, we've never even tried protecting against this
   specific attack, so maybe we can just ignore it for now. And the
   Tor Browser doesn't try either -- once they add sandboxing
   profiles, I bet they'll need to think about that too, so one way to
   do it would be to start a discussion with them about this problem,
   and consider it as a non-blocker for now. One idea we had with
   boyska was to add a confirmation dialog when one clicks the "New
   Identity" button in the Tor Browser, that makes it clear what's
   going to be lost (e.g. tabs and clipboard, which surprises a lot of
   users in my experience, see [[!tails_ticket 7709]]), warns them
   that their previous downloads will be deleted, or rather moved to
   a directory where that the Tor Browser hasn't access to.
   Another idea is to block the "New Identity" until the user has
   themselves emptied the browser files directory, e.g.:
   
       When I click on "New Identity" while there are files in one
            of the downloads directories
       Then I'm told "Tor Browser will be reset to a New Identity
            once you have emptied folders $x and $y"
       And then, once I have emptied the download directories
       Then Tor Browser is reset to a New Identity
   
   Food for thought.
