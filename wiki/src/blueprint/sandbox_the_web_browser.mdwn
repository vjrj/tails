User experience matters
=======================

Downloading files
-----------------

Tor Browser will be allowed to save files in
`/home/amnesia/Downloads/` only.

doc++: where to download, how to upload

Usability issue: if not enough space in RAM for hosting ~/Downloads/

* added a persistence setting for Downloads
* added a GNOME bookmark called "Downloads" when the Downloads
  persistence feature is enabled; remaining questions:
  - Rename this bookmark "Persistent Downloads"? But then users may
    lose data by mistake when they use read-only persistence option.
    OTOH, we have had a "Persistent" bookmark for years, even in
    read-only persistence mode, and nobody complains.
  - Rename this persistent directory and the corresponding bookmark to
    include the "Uploading files" use case? (see below)

Uploading files
---------------

Basically the same problem as for downloading files. Is it better to
share a common whitelisted directory, or to add a different one to
the whitelist?

Document that one should put files in the `/home/amnesia/Downloads`
folder before uploading them, and make sure that it's the folder
selected by default when clicking a "Browse" upload button on
a website?
