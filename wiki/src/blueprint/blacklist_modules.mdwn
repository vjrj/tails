Debian ships a long list of modules for wide support of devices, filesystems, protocols. Some of these modules have a pretty bad security track record, and some of those are simply not used by most of our users. 

Other distributions like Ubuntu[1] and Fedora[2] already ship a blacklist for various network protocols which aren't much in use by users and have a poor security track record.
