Misc. notes
===========

Regarding the success seen with `bootia32.efi`: why would a 32-bit
GRUB2 EFI boot loader automatically chainload to our syslinux?

Or is it that `bootia32.efi` is actually from another El Torito image,
that ships syslinux?

Debian's relevant code lives in the debian-cd, grub2 and
debian-installer Git repositories. Look for `bootia32.efi`.

Maybe also copy to `EFI/BOOT/boot.efi`: grub2's changelog says that
`grub-install` copies `bootia32.efi` to `boot.efi`, to better support
old Macs.

Potential hardware
==================

All of the following tablets are based on the Intel Bay Trail platform with 32-bit UEFI firmware and ship with Windows 8.1 except where noted. LCD resolutions are generally 1,280x800 pixels, except where noted.

They should all be able to run GNU/Linux from USB with the right boot code, but device drivers are sometimes a problem.

There are significant variations in specific firmware features among these devices. For example, it's unclear if all of these models can cold-boot from USB, or if some may need to start Windows and then use the "boot from USB" feature. Most have Secure Boot enabled by default, but this feature can usually be disabled.
