Misc. notes
===========

Regarding the success seen with `bootia32.efi`: why would a 32-bit
GRUB2 EFI boot loader automatically chainload to our syslinux?

Or is it that `bootia32.efi` is actually from another El Torito image,
that ships syslinux?

Debian's relevant code lives in the debian-cd, grub2 and
debian-installer Git repositories. Look for `bootia32.efi`.

Maybe also copy to `EFI/BOOT/boot.efi`: grub2's changelog says that
`grub-install` copies `bootia32.efi` to `boot.efi`, to better support
old Macs.

Potential hardware
==================

Bay Trail, UEFI 32-bit, boots Tails from USB with some hacks
------------------------------------------------------------

 * Toshiba Encore 2
   - $100
   - 1 GB RAM, 8"
   - what exactly is needed to boot Tails?

Bay Trail, UEFI 32-bit, boots GNU/Linux from USB
------------------------------------------------

 * Acer Aspire Switch 10
   - $300
   - 2 GB RAM, 10", hybrid

 * Asus T100
   - $290
   - 2 GB RAM, 10", hybrid
   - hardware support on Linux was not entirely awful a year ago, but
     requires proprietary firmware; not sure where things are at now

 * Asus T100TA
   - $300
   - 2 GB RAM, 10", hybrid
   - 1 USB + 1 micro USB
   - does the T100's hardware support status apply here too?

 * Dell Venue 8 Pro 3000
   - $170
   - 1 GB RAM, 8"

 * Dell Venue 8 Pro 5000
   - $210
   - 2 GB RAM, 8"

 * HP Stream 7:
   - $100
   - 1 GB RAM
   - hardware support on Linux seems not entirely awful, but requires
     a few out-of-tree drivers:

 * Lenovo Miix 2
   - $220
   - 2 GB RAM

Bay Trail, UEFI 32-bit, boots GRUB from USB
-------------------------------------------

 * WinBook TW700:
   - $70
   - 1 GB RAM
   - say I want to boot from a USB stick; do I have to set this up
     from Windows first? if yes, do I have to do it *every* time
     I want to boot from this USB stick, or only once for all?

Needs more research
-------------------

 * ASUS VivoTab 8
   - $190
   - Bay Trail, 2 GB RAM, 8"
   - 32-bit UEFI?

 * HP Stream 8: not found any info online regarding running Linux on
   it, but it may be mostly the same as the Stream 7

Boots current Tails and thus uninteresting here
-----------------------------------------------

 * HP Slate 500
 * Samsung Series 7 Slate
 * Microsoft Surface Pro
