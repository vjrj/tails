Known issues
============

* Mac: *some* Mac need rEFInd installed to boot Tails in UEFI mode.
* ThinkPad X230: when booting in UEFI mode, the syslinux boot menu is
  not displayed properly, and one cannot see the kernel command-line
  when editing it.
* VirtualBox: at least one version of VirtualBox cannot boot Tails
  in UEFI mode.

Miscellaneous test results
==========================

* With Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro, the UEFI nightly release does work, while it didn't
  work previously.
* boots on ThinkPad X220 (syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1 and
  3:6.03~pre1+dfsg-1~bpo60+1) in UEFI mode
* ThinkPad X230 (syslinux 3:6.03~pre1+dfsg-1~bpo60+1):
  - boots fine in UEFI mode, but displays the syslinux menu very much
    translated to the top: one can see the two menu entries, but
    nothing else, so if one must edit the kernel command-line, they
    have to do it blindly
  - boots fine in Legacy BIOS mode, so at least we have no hardware
    support regression here
* boots on ThinkPenguin Royal (syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1 and 6.03~pre1+dfsg-1)
* boots on MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 9,2 (EFI 2.9), and MacBook Pro
  13-inch Late 2011 8,1 (EFI 2.7), both with and without rEFInd *if*
  `menu background splash.png` is removed from `stdmenu.cfg`; adding
  `menu resolution 640 480` before `menu background` makes the menu
  display "correctly" (only taking 1/4 of the screen, but oh well),
  *but* the system does not boot; without rEFInd, one has to press Alt
  before powering the laptop up, and keep it pressed until a menu
  appears, and then choose the entry that's called *Boot EFI* (as
  every other entry) and looks like a USB stick.
* on MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 with rEFInd, one has to choose
  *Fallback boot loader from Tails* in rEFInd to boot, as the *Boot
  Linux from Tails* entry does nothing at all (syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1
  and 6.03~pre1+dfsg-1)
* The ThinkPenguin Royal does not detect the bootloader if installed
  as `EFI/Tails/syslinux.efi`; hence the use of the fallback bootloader
  path (`BOOT/bootx64.efi`), which should work on more hardware.
* tails-i386-feature_uefi-0.23-20131222T0855Z-8acf864.iso
  boots fine on a Apple MacBook Air 13" mid 2011 (MacBookAir4,2)
  once installed with Tails Installer
* MacBook Pro 15-inch Mid 2010 (6,2) boots fine with rEFInd and
  tails-i386-feature_uefi-0.23-20131222T0855Z-8acf864.iso, *if* `menu
  background splash.png` is removed from `stdmenu.cfg`; if one
  adds `menu resolution 640 480` before `menu background`, the system
  does not boot.
* Lenovo ThinkPad X130e:
  tails-i386-feature_uefi-0.23-20140104T0920Z-3305611.iso boots fine.
* Lenovo E325: tails-i386-feature_uefi-0.23-20140104T0920Z-3305611.iso
  boots fine.
* MacBook Air Original (1,1): one has to press Esc twice in rEFInd to
  have it see the USB stick; then, rEFInd apparently loads syslinux,
  that fails to display its menu, even after commenting out most
  menu-related setting that has to do with color or positioning.
  Finally, Tails does not boot.
* ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. X55VD: boots fine with `menu background
  splash.png` removed (both with CSM enabled and disabled); only boots
  in CSM mode with `menu background splash.png` kept in place
* Boots fine on ThinkPad W520 (tails-i386-feature_uefi-1.0-20140324T1026Z-dd350d4.iso).
* Boots fine on Lenovo ThinkPad E320 (tails-i386-feature_uefi-1.1-20140407T1357Z-02a2adf)
* Boots fine on Macbook Pro 11,3 (15 Inch Retina-Late 2013)
* Boots fine on Macbook Air 3,1 in UEFI mode
* Boots fine on HP/Compaq 6330s in UEFI mode
