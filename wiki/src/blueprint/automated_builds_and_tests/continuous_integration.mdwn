## buildbot

We [[used to have a buildbot setup|todo/automated_builds_and_tests/buildbot]].

buildbot ([homepage](http://buildbot.net)) is a continous integration
bot, able to communicate over mail or IRC. Used by many projects.

Buildbot can be seen as a [framework](http://jacobian.org/writing/buildbot/) to
deploy continuous integration. It has no real configuration file, but
what deserves this role is a file that can be thought programatically.
Thus it provide a very flexible environment that can be customize for
most projects needs.

Some interesting pages, might be worth reading for people willing to
play with buildbot and understand its logic :

* [Chromium's buildbot config](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/tools/build),
  which is the one driving their [builbot instance](http://build.chromium.org/)
* [Buildbot's documentation](http://buildbot.net/buildbot/docs/latest/)
* Tor project's [buildbot
  configuration](https://gitweb.torproject.org/admin/buildbot-conf.git)

## Jenkins

We currently use Jenkins. See [[our dedicated page|automated builds
and tests/jenkins]] for our notes about it.
