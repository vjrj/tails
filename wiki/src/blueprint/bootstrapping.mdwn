[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through a bootstrapping medium)
  - Create persistence

Subpages
========

Check the following subpages to see the improvements that we proposed in
different area of that process:

  - [[ISO verification|verification]]
  - [[Browser extension|extension]]
  - [[Tails Installer|installer]]
  - [[Booting|booting]]
  - [[Upgrades|upgrade]]

2015
====

Over 2015 we will work on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in Debian
  - [[Browser extensions|download_extension]] for automatic verification of the ISO
  - [[Web assistant|web_assistant]] to guide the user throughout this process

Involved tools
--------------

[[!img tools.png link=tools.fodg]]

Notes:

- **Debian Hacker** corresponds to a path on the command line only. This
  main benefit is to go through the **Debian keyring** verification.
- **Debian** is a path for Debian derivatives where Tails Installer is
  available. That should be the case of Ubuntu starting from 15.10, and
  Debian Stretch unless we backport it for Jessie ([[!tails_ticket 8805]]).
- **Other OS** is Windows, Mac OS X, Fedora, etc.
- **Debian keyring** are command line instructions for verifying the
  Tails signing key against the Debian keyring.
- **Extension from Debian** takes for granted that the ISO verification
  extension will be available in Debian ([[!tails_ticket 8822]]. That
  might not be the case and then people would fallback on "Extension
  from browser".
- **GNOME Disks** now has a "Restore Disk Image" feature which should do the
  trick and is widely available, see [[!tails_ticket 8664]].
- **UUI** has been our canonical installer for years, but we should also test
  **Rufus**, see [[!tails_ticket 7034]].
- **DiskUtils** should be tested on Mac, see [[!tails_ticket 8802]].

Use cases
=========

This is a brainstorming on the different use cases dealing with
downloading, verifying, installing, and upgrading Tails.
This list should be useful to check whether all scenarios are covered.
The comments, placed after ':' correspond to our rough objectives for
2015.
