Design by design
================

Tails is designed to be an easy-to-use Live operating system as well as a toolkit for privacy and anonymity for the masses.

We organized several workshops at NUMA to improve the usability of Tails. We realized that it is hard for people who are not tech-savvy and/or new to Tails:

- to understand what Tails is;
- to install Tails;
- to boot Tails.

We want to improve this situation. 
First-time visitors on the Tails website should be able to enjoy a consistent experience, from understanding if Tails is the right tool for them, to achieving their actual goals by using it.


From the inside, to the outside
===============================

We want to go from the inside to the outside, from the skeleton to the surface. E.g. having a rocking website _first_ might lead potential users to think that Tails is easy enough for them, while it is not the case yet, which could be problematic in some cases.

This is why, hereafter you will find a description of the logical order of steps. Of course, we can still work simultaneously on all of these steps, *but* it is useful to keep the whole roadmap in mind along the way.
