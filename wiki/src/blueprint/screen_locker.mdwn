[[!meta title="Screen locker"]]

See also [[!tails_ticket 5684]].

Tails is currently lacking a screen locker and this has been a frequent
feature request. For example, as Tails is been adopted more and more by
journalists, they want to be able to leave their computer unattended in
their office to go to the toilets for a minute and have their screen
locked.

How do other live distributions do that?
========================================

  - [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org/)
    - No password whatsoever â†’ not possible to lock (or unlock!)
    - http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Getting-Started-with-Knoppix-7.3
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: KDE
  - [Grml](http://grml.org/)
    - Custom script called
      [grml-lock](https://github.com/grml/grml-scripts/blob/master/usr_bin/grml-lock)
      which is a wrapper around vlock that asks for a password on first use.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: fluxbox
  - [Jondo Live](https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondo-live-cd.html)
    - Ask for user password on boot, then I didn't find a way of locking the
      screen xlock. No xlock.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: XFCE
  - [Kali](http://www.kali.org/)
    - Lock screen through GNOME and the default 'toor' password.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: GNOME
  - [Tanglu](http://www.tanglu.org/)
    - Lock screen through GNOME and the default 'live' password.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: GNOME
  - [Debian Live](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/)
    - Lock screen through GNOME and the default 'live' password.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: GNOME

Which password to use?
======================

It is already possible to set an administration password from Tails
Greeter, and we could reuse it for unlocking the screen. But we also
need a solution for when no administration password has been set.

During the [[201412 monthly meeting|contribute/meeting/201412]] we
proposed to prompt for a password before locking the screen for the
first time, if there is no administration password.

How to activate it?
===================

  - Through the better power off button (#5322).
  - Automatically after X minutes of idle if a password has been set
    already.
  - Through the usual GNOME shortcut: Meta+L

Implementation
==============

  - Use a different PAM config for the screensaver
  - Turn the admin password into the root one, and use the user
    password's as the locker's one.
