[[!meta title="Screen locker"]]

See also [[!tails_ticket 5684]].

Tails is currently lacking a screen locker and this has been a frequent
feature request. For example, as Tails is been adopted more and more by
journalists, they want to be able to leave their computer unattended in
their office to go to the toilets for a minute and have their screen
locked.

How do other live distributions do that?
========================================

  - [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org/)
    - No password whatsoever â†’ not possible to lock (or unlock!)
    - http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Getting-Started-with-Knoppix-7.3
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: KDE
    - Might be interested in our solution.
  - [Grml](http://grml.org/)
    - Already have a custom script called
      [grml-lock](https://github.com/grml/grml-scripts/blob/master/usr_bin/grml-lock)
      which is a wrapper around vlock that asks for a password on first use.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: fluxbox
  - [Jondo Live](https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondo-live-cd.html)
    - Ask for user password on boot, then I didn't find a way of locking the
      screen xlock. No xlock.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: XFCE
  - [Kali](http://www.kali.org/)
    - Lock screen through GNOME and the default 'toor' password.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: GNOME
    - Low interest in our solution as Kali is not mainly used in live environment.
  - [Tanglu](http://www.tanglu.org/)
    - Lock screen through GNOME and the default 'live' password.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: GNOME
  - [Debian Live](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/)
    - Lock screen through GNOME and the default 'live' password.
    - Base: Debian
    - Desktop: GNOME

Which password to use?
======================

It is already possible to set an administration password from Tails
Greeter, and we could reuse it for unlocking the screen. But we also
need a solution for when no administration password has been set.

During the [[201412 monthly meeting|contribute/meeting/201412]] we
proposed to prompt for a password before locking the screen for the
first time, if there is no administration password.

How to activate it?
===================

  - Through the better power off button (#5322).
  - Through the usual GNOME shortcut: Meta+L
  - If a password has been set already:
    - Automatically after X minutes of idle.
    - When closing the lid.

Implementation
==============

An initial implementation was started in [[!tails_gitweb_branch
feature/better_power_off_button]], and reverted since it turned out to be more
complicated than originally thought. This implementation and the problems
listed bellow were discussed on the tails-dev ML in November 2012.

Ideas to implement the password prompt before the first locking:

  - Use a different PAM config for the screensaver
  - Turn the admin password into the root one, and use the user
    password's as the locker's one.
