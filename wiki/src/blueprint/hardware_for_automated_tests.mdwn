Rationale
==========

We need more CPU and RAM to be able to automatically test the ISOs build by our
jenkins. (tracked by [[!tails_ticket 5288]])

See [[!tails_ticket 7631]] for the specifications of the required hardware.

From there 3 options can be the basis for a decision.


Costs
======

## Option A: upgrade lizard

Aka. resell the hardware we replace to Riseup, and get new better hardware.
No need for a new case or new HDD and heatsinks.

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB)          - $393,75
 * 2 x Intel® E5-2650Lv3-1.8Ghz/12C, 30M, 9.6GT/s, 65W LGA2011 CPU               - $1,427.35 x 2
 * 1 x 128GB of RAM                                                              - $2000

Total   --- **$5400**


## Option B : 2nd box dedicated to the tests

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB)          - $393,75
 * 2 x E5-2630Lv3 - 1.8Ghz/8C, 20M, 8.0GT/s, 55W                                 - $657.50 x 2
 * 1 x 128GB of RAM                                                              - $2000
 * 2 x WD 500GB/10K RPM, 64M, 6Gb/s, 2.5" SATA3 HD                               - $141,50 x 2
 * 2 x Heatsinks                                                                 - $50 x 2
 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W                - $345,50

Total   --- **$4500**


## Option C : 2nd box with best CPUs

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB)          - $393,75
 * 2 x Intel® E5-2650Lv3-1.8Ghz/12C, 30M, 9.6GT/s, 65W LGA2011 CPU               - $1,427.35 x 2
 * 1 x 128GB of RAM								 - $2000
 * 2 x WD 500GB/10K RPM, 64M, 6Gb/s, 2.5" SATA3 HD                               - $141,50 x 2
 * 2 x Heatsinks                                                                 - $50 x 2
 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W                - $345,50

Total   --- **$6200**


Pros and Cons
==============

In term of costs, options A and B are quite similar if we sell the remaining
"old" hardware in A. But this has to be decided. Option C is more expensive.

Upgrading lizard to better CPUs (option A) has the benefit of not adding much
more sysadmin work on our plate.

On the other hand we'll have 46 of 48 CPUs threads, and not much options apart
from buying a new machine if we want more. This option tend to assume we won't
need much more CPUs in the near future.

Option B and C (new machine) in the contrary brings more sysadmin works.

They also bring the question of the connectivity between the 2 machines. They
both have 2 nics, so they could be connected through their unused one, but
probably require to setup a VPN or something.

They also raise the question of deciding where to put the different
services/VMs.

Option B will have 2 x 24 CPU threads. Lizard could handle the current and
upcoming VMs (18 threads), the new one could get the automatic test VMs (6-12
threads), yet the ISO builders (16 theads) won't be easy to fit somewhere.

With option C, the new machine could probably get the whole build and test chain
(ISO builders and testers) say 30 threads, with the jenkins vm, and still some room
for more builders. Lizard would handle the current and upcoming VMs (18 threads)
nicely.
