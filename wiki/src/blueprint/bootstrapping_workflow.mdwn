[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through a bootstrapping medium)
  - Create persistence

[[Diagram of the detailed workflow as of January 2014|2014.fodg]]

2015
====

Over 2015 we will work on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in Debian
  - [[Browser extensions|download_extension]] for automatic verification of the ISO
  - [[Web assistant|web_assistant]] to guide the user throughout this process

Future
======

  - OpenPGP verification in Tails Installer
  - Persistence configuration in Tails Greeter
  - Detect if it is the first boot of a manual installation, or if it is
    a manual installation in general, and suggest to clone on another
    USB stick.
