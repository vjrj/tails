[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through a bootstrapping medium)
  - Create persistence

[[Diagram of the detailed workflow as of January 2014|2014.fodg]]

2015
====

Over 2015 we will work on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in Debian
  - [[Browser extensions|download_extension]] for automatic verification of the ISO
  - [[Web assistant|web_assistant]] to guide the user throughout this process

Use cases
=========

This is a brainstorming on the different use cases dealing with
downloading, verifying, and installing (or upgrading) Tails from ISO.
This list should be useful to check whether all scenarios are covered.
The comments, placed after ':' correspond to our rough objectives for
2015.

Future
======

  - OpenPGP verification in Tails Installer
  - Persistence configuration in Tails Greeter
  - Detect if it is the first boot of a manual installation, or if it is
    a manual installation in general, and suggest to clone on another
    USB stick.
