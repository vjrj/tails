	<p>It is important to check the <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia

	<div class="caution">

	<p>Those techniques rely on standard HTTPS and <span

	page|doc/about/warning#man-in-the-middle]], you
	could still be victim of a man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS.

	<p>As a consequence, <strong>they don't provide you with a

	<p><strong>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our
	OpenPGP key.</strong>
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
	privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
	Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image
	integrity.</p>

	<p>If you already know how to use an OpenPGP key you can download it
	straight away:</p>

	<p>The Tails signing key that you downloaded from this website could

	<p>Finding a way of trusting better Tails signing key would allow you to
	authenticate better the ISO image you downloaded. The following page
