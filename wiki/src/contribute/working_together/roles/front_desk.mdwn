User support
============

  - Do user support by email:
    - Reply to bug reports received on tails-bugs@boum.org (empty reports might
      be silently ignored).
    - Reply to private user support requests received on
      tails-support-private@boum.org.
    - Make sure everything is replied on tails-support@boum.org, while leaving
      space for other people to participate.
  - Improve the FAQ incrementally based on the work done by email, and do
    whatever small tasks will make the frontdesk job's easier in the future.
  - Do user support on IRC if you feel like it.

General communication watchdog
==============================

  - Try to do something about the
    [new tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=157)
    that appear in Redmine. An Atom feed is available for easier
    monitoring, see the link at the bottom of that page.
  - Administer and moderate our general purpose public mailing lists:
    - [tails-dev@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-dev)
    - [tails-l10n@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-l10n)
    - [tails-project@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-project)
    - [tails-support@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-support)
    - [tails-testers@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-testers)

Meetings management
===================

  - Announce public meetings and low-hanging fruits sessions on:
    * Twitter
    * [Tor Weekly News](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorWeeklyNews) (follow the *Next steps* link)
  - Write report of low-hanging fruits sessions, and send it to tails-dev@ if attended.
  - Write & publish the minutes of the public meeting if attended.
    - Explain in details the decisions that were taken.
    - Keep track of the brainstorming that we did if no decision was taken.
    - Include names of people who took responsibilities.
    - Update Redmine tickets accordingly and point them to the meeting notes
      (unless someone else volunteers to do it on some tickets).
  - Publish the monthly report.
