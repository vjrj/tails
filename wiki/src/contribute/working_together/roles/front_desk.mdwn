User support
============

  - Do user support by email:
    - Reply to bug reports received on tails-bugs@boum.org (empty reports might
      be silently ignored).
    - Reply to private user support requests received on
      tails-support-private@boum.org.
    - Make sure everything is replied on tails-support@boum.org, while leaving
      space for other people to participate.
  - Improve the FAQ incrementally based on the work done by email, and do
    whatever small tasks will make the frontdesk job's easier in the future.
  - Do user support on IRC if you feel like it.

General communication watchdog
==============================

  - Try to do something about the
    [new tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=157)
    that appear in Redmine. An Atom feed is available for easier
    monitoring, see the link at the bottom of that page.
  - Administer and moderate our general purpose public mailing lists:
    - [tails-dev@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-dev)
    - [tails-l10n@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-l10n)
    - [tails-project@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-project)
    - [tails-support@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-support)
    - [tails-testers@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/admin/tails-testers)
