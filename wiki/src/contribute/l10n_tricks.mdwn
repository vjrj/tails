Compare the content of two PO files
===================================

Here is how to check out the differences between two PO files without
caring about strings order, line breaks or comments.

    diff -u <(msgfmt -o - translation/es/es.po | msgunfmt) \
            <(msgfmt -o - persistence-setup/po/es.po | msgunfmt)

The syntax is bash specific. Replace the paths to the two PO files you
are interested in comparing.

Calculate statistics on the translations
========================================

Run the [[language statistics.sh]] script.

Build the wiki offline
======================

To check your translations before you send them, you may want to browse the
wiki offline. See the [[corresponding documentation|contribute/build/website]].

Search for fuzzy strings with Vim
=================================

Ran inside Vim, the following command will search recursively for *fuzzy*
inside *.fr.po* files

    :vimgrep /fuzzy/ **/*.fr.po |:copen

To switch easily between the file list and the editor, using Alt + Arrow
up/down, you can add those lines in .vimrc:

    nmap <silent> <A-Up> :wincmd k<CR>
    nmap <silent> <A-Down> :wincmd j<CR>

Check the validity of PO files
==============================

Use the tool [i18nspector](http://jwilk.net/software/i18nspector).

To copy, install and run it issue the following commands in the folder where
you want to download it:

    apt-get install i18nspector/unstable
    i18nspector <PO file>

Run i18nspector on the whole wiki
=================================

    cd wiki/src
    contribute/l10n_tricks/check_po.sh

Rewrap files
============

To rewrap one .po file:

    msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po

To rewrap several .po files:

    for f in $(find . -type f -name .po) ; do msgcat --width=80 -o \
         "${f}.new" "$f" ; mv -f "${f}.new" "$f" ; done

To rewrap a .mdwn file:

    fold -s -w 80 translate.mdwn > translate.mdwn.out

Quickly update several repositories
===================================

Tails is split in [[several git repositories|contribute/git]]: tails-greeter,
whisperback, persistence-setup, *etc*.

If you cloned those differents repositories in the same folder, you can pull them all
in a row with the following bash script:

    #!/bin/sh
        for d in $(find . -type d -name ".git" | sed 's/\/.git\+$//' ); do
           echo "Current repository: $d";
           cd $d && git pull && cd - || exit 1
    done

This will basically check in all subfolders if there is an existing `.git` folder,
and run `git pull` if appropriate.

Remove autogenerated PO files
=============================

When building the wiki, ikiwiki often generates many PO files that you don't
need to take into account or commit if you are working on the documentation or
only on one language. This [[script|git-clean-po]] does a checkout on all of
the modified PO files in your working tree. **Make sure to do `git add` on the
files that you modified before running it**, otherwise your changes will be
lost.
