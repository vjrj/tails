[[!meta title="Low-hanging fruits sessions"]]

Each month a low-hanging fruits session is organized. During these
sessions, we spend some time together working on many small tasks that take less
than two hours each.

It currently happens on **twelfth  day** of the month on
[[#tails-dev|contribute/chat]] at 9pm CEST or CET (7pm or 8pm UTC).
Everybody is welcome to attend, existing contributors and those who
want to become one.

The goals are to:

* Bypass the somewhat cumbersome paperwork of the usual email-based
  [[review and merge process|contribute/merge_policy]]: during
  low-hanging fruits sessions, we exceptionally allow ourselves to go
  through it live on IRC.
* Enjoy doing non-urgent things and have some fun together.
* Get a lot of small improvements into the next Tails release.
* Cleanup our todo list a bit.
