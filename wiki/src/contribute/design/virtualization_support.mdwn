Warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

We tell users, when running inside a VM, that they are implicitly
trusting both the VM software *and* the host OS; the warning message
points to a [[dedicated documentation page|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]].
This is needed to avoid creating a false sense of security, which is
often worse than no security and a clear sense of it.

The detection is done with `systemd-detect-virt`.

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-virt-notify-user]]

A bit more work is [[!tails_todo virtualization_support desc="left to do"]].
