[[!meta title="Git merge policy: how to submit code"]]

All development should happen in topic branches. For a new feature XXX, it should
be named `feature/XXX`. For a bugfix about YYY, it should be named
`bugfix/YYY`. Ideally, include the relevant ticket number in the topic
branch name, e.g. `bugfix/7173-upgrade-syslinux`.

When the developer thinks it is good enough and has tested it, she must:

- if you have the commit bit, merge the topic branch into the `experimental` one
- set the ticket's *QA Check* field to *Ready for QA*
- assign this ticket to nobody (aka. unassign it from yourself) by
  default. Unless it's clear to you that the current release manager won't be able
  or willing to do this specific review; in that case, _you_ shall try
  to find someone else to do the review, and assign the ticket
  to them.
- set the ticket's *Feature Branch* field
- set the ticket's *Target version* field to the release you would
  like your changes to be in
- ask for a review and merge (in devel generally, in testing
  or stable for bugfixes) by writing to the `tails-dev@boum.org`
  mailing-list

Then, if the reviewer asks for more development to be done before
merging, they should set the ticket's *QA Check* field back to *Needs
more dev* or *Needs more info* state, and
from now on it's the responsibility of the branch/ticket "holder" to
change it back to *Ready for QA* once they consider the issues raised by
the reviewer are fixed.
