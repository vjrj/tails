[[!meta title="Git merge policy: review and merge process"]]

## Review

- When you start doing a review'n'merge, assign the relevant ticket to
  you, in order to avoid duplicated work.
- Build the branch (or experimental) and test the feature.
- Check the diff e.g. with `git log -p`. Beware of changes introduced
  by merge commits: either add the `-cc` option to `git log`, or use
  `git diff` after reviewing the individual patches.
- Check the APT suite with 
  `ssh reprepro@incoming.deb.tails.boum.org reprepro list [bugfix|feature]-<name-with-dashes>`
- Check the user and design documentation.
- Check the ticket.
- Changes proposed by new contributors, or by the patch'n'forget kind,
  shall respectively be applied once they are in *good enough* state.
  That is, once the core developers team feels like maintaining it on
  the long run in case the initial submitter disappears. Such
  maintenance includes: polishing the proposed changes to make them fit
  for release; writing and updating the design and end-user
  documentations; fixing bugs.

## Merge

On the Git side, merge the branch with `--no-ff` :

- for a new feature: into `devel`; then merge `devel` into
  `experimental`
- for a fix on top on the last RC: into `testing`; then merge
  `testing` into `devel`, and `devel` into `experimental`
- for a fix on top of the last stable: into `stable`; then merge
  `stable` into `devel`, and `devel` into `experimental`

On the APT repository side,
[[merge the suites|APT_repository#workflow-merge-topic-branch]].

## Book keeping

1. Update the *QA Check* field on the ticket. If there is no remaining
   tasks listed on the ticket, then change its status to *Fix
   committed*; else, ask the branch submitter to split the remaining tasks
   into other tickets.
1. Push the updated branch to the master Git repository.
1. If you merged into a branch that is built by [our
   Jenkins](https://jenkins.tails.boum.org/), also push it to the Git
   repository on lizard (`gitolite@git.puppet.tails.boum.org:tails`).
1. Reply to the email that requested the review.
