[[!meta title="Releasing the Tor Browser"]]

Have a look at

* <https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/>
* <https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~linus/builds/>

and see if the desired version is available. We prefer
`archive.torproject.org` since the other sources periodically cleans
up old releases. Set `DIST_URL` to the chosen url, and set `VERSION`
to the desired TBB version, for example:

    DIST_URL=https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/
    VERSION=4.0

Fetch the version's `sha256sums.txt` and `sha256sums.txt.asc` and
verify with `gpg`:

    wget ${DIST_URL}/${VERSION}/sha256sums.txt{,.asc} && \
    gpg --verify sha256sums.txt.asc

Filter the tarballs we want and make them available at build time,
when the tarballs are fetched:

    grep "\<tor-browser-linux32-.*\.tar.xz$" sha256sums.txt > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt

Then update the url to the one chosen above:

    echo "${DIST_URL}" | sed "s,^https://,http://," > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt

NOTE: We must use http (not http**s**) due to limitations/bugs in
`apt-cacher-ng`, which often is used in Tails build
environments. However, it is of no consequence since we verify the
checksum file.

Lastly, commit:

    git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-*.txt \
        -m "Upgrade TBB to ${VERSION}."
