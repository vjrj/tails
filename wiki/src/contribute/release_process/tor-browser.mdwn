[[!meta title="Releasing the Tor Browser"]]

Have a look at

* <https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/>
* <https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~linus/builds/>

and see if the desired version is available. Set `DIST_URL` to the
chosen URL, and set `VERSION` to the desired Tor Browser version, for
example:

    DIST_URL=https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/
    VERSION=4.0

Fetch the version's hash file and its detached signature, and verify
with GnuPG:

    wget ${DIST_URL}/${VERSION}/sha256sums.txt{,.asc} && \
    gpg --verify sha256sums.txt.asc sha256sums.txt

Filter the tarballs we want and make them available at build time,
when the tarballs are fetched:

    grep --color=never "\<tor-browser-linux32-.*\.tar.xz$" sha256sums.txt > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt

Then update the URL to the one chosen above:

    echo "${DIST_URL}" | sed "s,^https://,http://," > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt

<div class="note">
<p>
We cannot use HTTPS due to limitations/bugs in
<code>apt-cacher-ng</code>, which often is used in Tails build
environments. However, it is of no consequence since we verify the
checksum file.
</p>
</div>

Lastly, commit:

    git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-*.txt \
        -m "Upgrade Tor Browser to ${VERSION}."
