Note that you need the qemu command, which is provided on wheezy by the `qemu-system` package.

* Start the VM

  - with a 64-bit CPU that supports PAE

        qemu -enable-kvm -cpu Nehalem -cdrom tails.iso -m 5120

  - with a 32-bit CPU that does not support PAE

        qemu -enable-kvm -cpu 486 -cdrom tails.iso -m 5120

* Open the qemu console (CTRL-ALT-2).
* Save physical memory to the `tails.dump` file (length is an integer, max size for one dump is 4G = 0xF0000000):

        pmemsave <start address> <length> <filename>

  e.g for 5G one has to do two dumps:

        pmemsave 0 0xFFFFFFFF tails14.dump
        pmemsave 0x100000000 0x40000000 tails5.dump
