### Run the tests the TBB folks use

* http://websocketstest.com: WebSockets are enabled. It's unclear
  what the expected result should be.
* http://phoul.github.io: Doesn't finish.
* http://www.dnsleaktest.com/: Doesn't finish.

### Compare the fingerprint of Tails and the latest TBB using at least https://panopticlick.eff.org/

There's certificate issue making panopticlick inaccessible.

### WebRTC should be disabled

None of the getUserMedia demos seem to work.

0.23~rc1

Iceweasel WebRTC
----------------

- getUserMedia → Video + Picture
  - on Tails 0.22.1: NO_DEVICES_FOUND
  - on Tails 0.23: Stop - Pause/Play - Snapshot
- getUserMedia → Audio + Audio/Video
  - on Tails 0.22.1: dialog to share a microphone + Stop - Pause/Play - Snapshot
  - on Tails 0.23: Stop - Pause/Play - Snapshot

intrigeri: I see nothing working for real, and the landing page says
"mozRTCPeerConnection is missing!", so perhaps that's OK-ish. I can't
find any related change in the patches we apply, strange.
