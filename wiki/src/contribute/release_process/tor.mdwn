Note: we're _not_ using Git, as weasel's script do lots of clever
things between the Git tree and the source package. So let's simply
take whatever he has uploaded to Debian and build it against
wheezy-backports, to get seccomp support.

1. Make sure you have Debian unstable APT deb-src sources configured.

2. Make sure you have an up-to-date wheezy-backports i386 pbuider chroot.

3. Download the source package from Debian unstable, extract it, cd
   into the directory:

   	WORKDIR=$(mktemp -d)
   	cd "$WORKDIR" && \
   	apt-get source tor/unstable && \
   	cd tor-*

4. Set `$DISTRIBUTION` to the name of the Tails APT suite you'll want
   to upload to, e.g.:

   	DISTRIBUTION=feature-tor-custom-build

5. Update `debian/changelog`:

   	UNSTABLE_VERSION=$(dpkg-parsechangelog  --count 1 -SVersion)
   	WHEEZY_TPO_VERSION="${UNSTABLE_VERSION}~d70.wheezy+1"
   	TAILS_VERSION="${WHEEZY_TPO_VERSION}+tails1"
   	dch --newversion "$TAILS_VERSION" --force-bad-version  \
   	   --distribution "$DISTRIBUTION" --force-distribution \
   	   "Rebuild on wheezy-backports to get seccomp support"
   
   Check the resulting `debian/changelog` entry.

6. Build in your wheezy-backports i386 chroot.

7. Tweak the resulting `.changes` file so that it includes the
   upstream tarball:

   	changestool *.changes includeallsources

8. Sign the resulting package:

   	debsign $CHANGES_FILE

9. Upload the resulting package:

   	dupload --to tails $CHANGES_FILE
