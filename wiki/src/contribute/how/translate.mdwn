# For native English speakers

Most of Tails developers are not native English speakers so you're
more than welcome to correct or improve our English.
For this, you can either follow the [[Git workflow|translate/with_Git]] or
[[propose|contribute/talk]] another way that suits you better to share
your improvements with us.

# Translate Tails custom programs

You can help correct, improve, or complete the translations of Tails
programs into your native language:

* **For French**, the translation team uses Git. Read its [[dedicated
  documentation|translate/team/fr]] for translators.
* **For other languages**, read [[translating with
  Transifex|translate/with_Transifex]].
  Tails programs can be translated into more than 140 languages this way.

# Translate this website

You can also translate this website, which includes the Tails
[[documentation|doc]]. This is done [[translate/with_Git]].

The translations are peer-reviewed and thus, you need to get into contact with
a language team if you want to participate.
In general, you can contact the translation teams via the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].

<a id="language-teams"></a>

Currently, there are three active **language teams**:

* [[French|translate/team/fr]]
* [[German|translate/team/de]]
* [[Portuguese|translate/team/pt]]

and three new language teams are being set up:

* Italian
* Spanish
* Turkish

If your language is not listed here, read the documentation
to [[add a new language|translate/team/new]].

# Mailing list for translators
