[[!meta title="Translation progress"]]

This page lists pages that are not 100% translated into a language.
To choose the language, select one of the "translation" links above. 

Note: This page itself does not need to be translated.

Note: The numbers count a page's incoming links, and thus, broadly, its importance.

## Full list of all pages needing translation:

[[!pagestats style=table pages="(smiley/* or directives/* or basewiki/*) and !*/discussion and currentlang() and needstranslation()"]]

## Pages that are more than 80%, but less than 100% translated:

(Good to work on if you want to maximise the number of fully translated pages.)

[[!pagestats style=table pages="(smiley/* or directives/* or basewiki/*) and !*/discussion and currentlang() and needstranslation() and !needstranslation(80)"]]

## Pages that are 80% or less translated:

[[!pagestats style=table pages="(smiley/* or directives/* or basewiki/*) and !*/discussion and currentlang() and needstranslation(80)"]]
