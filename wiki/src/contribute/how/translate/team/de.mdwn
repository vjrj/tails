[[!meta title="Translate Tails into German"]]

# What can be translated

* **This website** must be translated in the `master` branch of the
  [main Tails Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/).
  Please read the documentation about [[translating with
  Git|translate/with_Git]] first.

* The German team does not use Git to **translate Tails custom programs**.
  Instead, and for this part only, we rely on [[Transifex|translate/with_Transifex]].

# Glossaries used by the German translation team

We try to follow the [GNOME Guidelines](https://wiki.gnome.org/de/Uebersetzung)
and their glossaries:

* <https://wiki.gnome.org/de/StandardUebersetzungen>
* <https://wiki.gnome.org/de/Uebersetzung/Dokumentationen>

As well as the Transifex glossary of the Torproject (you need to be logged in with
Transifex to see this page):

* <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/glossary/l/de/>

For words not in these lists it is helpful to see
how they are translated (or not translated) in Wikipedia.

Often, we simply discuss on the [[mailing list for
translators|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/]] if
unsure which term applies best.
