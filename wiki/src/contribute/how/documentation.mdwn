<p>Tails documentation would greatly benefit from your help.</p>

Good documentation is difficult to keep up-to-date. If you find a typo
or an error in the documentation please let us know â€” ideally, by
submitting a patch with your correction.

# Writing

The documentation on the website is not freely editable. The way we
document things has serious security implications. People should be able
to trust the Tails website as much as they trust Tails itself.
Furthermore, every change in the documentation possibly breaks the
translations that were made of the previous version.

But there are still many ways you can start contributing:

  - We maintain a list of [documentation
    tasks](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=118).
    You can start writing a draft in the corresponding ticket and then
    [[ask us for review|contribute/talk]].

  - Small fixes and enhancements to the current documentation are
    greatly welcome. This can be done by [[sending us|contribute/talk]]
    Git patches, by publishing a [[Git]] branch, or simply by email on
    the public mailing list. In the general case, this work should be
    based on the `master` branch.

Documentation writers coordinate themselves using our usual
[[development communication channels|contribute/talk]].

Documentation writers should also read our [[documentation
guidelines|guidelines]].

If you want to test your contributions before to sharing them with us,
you can [[build and update the documentation
offline|contribute/build/website]].

# Translating

We want Tails [[end-user documentation|doc]] to be translated in
as many languages as possible. See the [[guidelines for
translators|contribute/how/translate]] for details.
