Join us on July 5-6 in Paris, to make online anonymity and digital
privacy usable by the masses! Whether you're a writer, a software
developer, a designer, a system administrator or just plain
interested, come learn about the challenges faced by Tails, and how
you can be part of the solution.

The Tails HackFest will bring together anyone interested in making
Tails more usable and more secure. This open event will be an intense
mix of teaching, drawing, coding, sharing, learning and celebrating.
