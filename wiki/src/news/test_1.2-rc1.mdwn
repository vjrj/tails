How to automatically upgrade from 1.1.2?
========================================

These steps allow you to automatically upgrade a device installed with <span
class="application">Tails Installer</span> from Tails 1.1.2 to Tails 1.2~rc1.

1. Start Tails 1.1.2 from a USB stick or SD card, and
   [[set an administration password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]].

1. Run this command in a <span class="application">Root
   Terminal</span> to select the "alpha" upgrade channel
   and start the upgrade:

       echo TAILS_CHANNEL=\"alpha\" >> /etc/os-release && \
            tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper

1. Once the upgrade has been installed, restart Tails and look at
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">System</span>&nbsp;â–¸
     <span class="guimenuitem">About Tails</span>
   </span>
   to confirm that the running system is Tails 1.2~rc1.

What's new since 1.1.2?
=======================

Notable changes since Tails 1.1.2 include:

  * Major new features
    - Install (most of) the Tor Browser, replacing our previous
      Iceweasel-based browser. The version installed is a development
      build based on Firefox 31.1.1.
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.5.8-rc.
    - Confine several important applications with AppArmor.

  * Bugfixes
    - Install Linux 3.16-2 from Debian unstable.

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.15, and isolate I2P traffic from the Tor
      Browser by adding a dedicated I2P Browser. Also, start I2P
      automatically upon network connection, when `i2p` is present on
      the kernel command line.
    - Make it clear that TrueCrypt will be removed in Tails 1.2.1
      ([[!tails_ticket 7739]]).
    - Enable VirtualBox guest additions by default ([[!tails_ticket
      5730]]). In particular this enables VirtualBox's display
      management service.
    - Make the OTR status in Pidgin clearer thanks to the formatting
      toolbar ([[!tails_ticket 7356]]).
    - Upgrade syslinux to 6.03-pre20, which should fix UEFI boot on
      some hardware.
