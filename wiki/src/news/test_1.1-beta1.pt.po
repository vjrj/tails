"* Major new features\n"
"  - Replace the Windows XP camouflage with an experimental Windows 8\n"
"    one.\n"
"  - UEFI boot support. This allows you to boot Tails from USB sticks\n"

"    problems, please have a look at the\n"
"    [[known issues for UEFI support|blueprint/UEFI/syslinux#known_issues]].\n"
"  - Install Linux 3.14 from Debian unstable for improved hardware support.\n"
"  - Improve integration when run inside VirtualBox. This enables, for\n"
"    instance, more screen resolutions, host-guest file and\n"
"    clipboard sharing. Unfortunately, full functionality is only\n"
"    available when using the 32-bit kernel.\n"

"  - Whisperback now sanitizes attached logs better with respect to DMI\n"
"    data, IPv6 addresses, and serial numbers (Closes\n"
"    [[!tails_ticket 6797]], [[!tails_ticket 6798]],\n"
