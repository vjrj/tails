There are numerous other changes that may not be apparent in the daily
operation of a typical user. Technical details of all the changes
are listed in the [Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog).

## New features

  - **[[Electrum|doc/anonymous_internet/electrum]]** is an easy to use bitcoin wallet. You can use the
    [[**Bitcoin Client** persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#electrum]]
    to store your *Electrum* configuration and wallet.

  - The **obfs4 pluggable transport** is now available to connect to Tor
    bridges. Pluggable transports transform the Tor traffic between the
    client and the bridge to help disguise Tor traffic from censors.

  - **[[Keyringer|doc/encryption_and_privacy/keyringer]]** lets you manage
    and share secrets using *OpenPGP* and *Git* from the command line.

## Upgrades and changes

  - The **Tor Browser** has additional operating system and data
    **security**. This security restricts reads and writes to a limited
    number of folders. [[Learn how to manipulate files|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]]
    with the new Tor Browser.
  - The **Ibus Vietnamese input method** is now supported.
  - **Improved support for OpenPGP smartcards** through the installation
    of *GnuPG* 2.
  - The **Mac and Linux manual installation** processes no longer require the
    `isohybrid` command. Removing the `isohybrid` command simplifies the
    installation.
  - The **tap-to-click** and **two-finger scrolling** trackpad settings
    are now enabled by default. This should be more intuitive for Mac
    users.
