There are numerous other changes that may not be apparent in the daily
operation of a typical user. Technical details of all the changes
are listed in the [Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog).

## New features

  - **Electrum Bitcoin** is an easy to use Bitcoin wallet provided as an
    optional installation. You can manually install Electrum Bitcoin
    with the [Installing Electrum Bitcoin procedure](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?page=doc%2Fanonymous_internet%2Felectrum&from=blueprint%2Fversion_1.3&do=create.).

  - Tor Bridges now support the **obfs4** pluggable transport. Pluggable
    transports transform the Tor traffic  between the client and the
    bridge. The obfs4 pluggable transport provides an additional
    pluggable transport to help disguise Tor traffic from censors.

  - The **Keyringer program** is an optional installation. Keyringer
    lets you manage and share secrets. You can manually install
    Keyringer with the [Installing Keyringer
    procedure](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?page=doc%2Fencryption_and_privacy%2Fkeyringer&from=blueprint%2Fversion_1.3&do=create).

## Upgrades and changes

  - The **Tor Browser** has additional operating system and data
    **security**. This security restricts reads and writes to a limited
    number of folders. [Learn more](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html#confinement)
    about how to manipulate files with the Tor Browser.
  - The **Ibus Vietnamese input method** is now supported.
  - The **maximum key-size for OpenPGP smartcards** is increased from
    3072 to 4096 bits for better smartcard security.
  - The **Mac and Linux installation** processes no longer require the
    isohybrid command. Removing the isohybrid command simplifies the
    installation.
  - The **tap-to-click** and **two-finger scrolling** trackpad settings
    are now enabled by default. This should be more intuitive for Mac
    users.
