The first Tails [HackFest](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/),
which took place on July 5-6 in Paris, was a great event: about 120 people
attended on Saturday, 70 people on Sunday. We shared some good workshops,
some very good food, and homemade beer in a nice and friendly atmosphere.

The slides of some talks have been
[published](https://tails.boum.org/promote/slides/), but there is more
to come.

The first Tails stickers were distributed and you can also make your
own! Just use [this SVG file](https://tails.boum.org/promote/tails-sticker.svg).

We are particularly happy that the HackFest attracted very different
people, so we were a quite diverse assembly. Probably thanks to our
[[anti-harassment policy|blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/policy]]
(thanks Genma for the frensh translation)...

Some people talked about the HackFest:

(please send links!)
