"Current Tails is based on GNOME 3.8 in \"Fallback\" mode. We are currently "
"upgrading Tails on top of the upcoming version on Debian (\"Jessie\")  which "
"is based on GNOME 3.14. The Windows camouflage should be upgraded to the "
"last version of GTK and ported from GNOME Panel to GNOME shell. That "
"includes GTK and GNOME Shell theming through CSS as well as writing a custom "
"GNOME Shell extension."

"The team currently working on Tails is very busy and decided to focus on the "
"core or the upgrade rather than on the Windows camouflage. We currently plan "
"to go ahead with the initial Tails Jessie release even if the Windows "
"camouflage is missing. However, we would love to ship a proper Windows "
"camouflage and think it's a good occasion for you to give a hand. We'll "
"provide support to anybody volunteering and work together on integrating the "
"new theme to upcoming Tails Jessie snapshots."
