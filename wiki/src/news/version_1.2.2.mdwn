[[!tag announce]]

Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.2.2, is out.

This release is an emergency release that changes the root certificate
which is used to verify automatic upgrades.

On January 3rd, the SSL certificate of our website hosting provider,
boum.org, will expire. The new certificate will be issued by a different
certificate authority. This certificate authority is verified by the
automatic upgrade mechanism of Tails.

As a consequence, versions
previous to 1.2.2 won't be able to do the next automatic upgrade to
version 1.2.3 and will receive an error message from *Tails Upgrader*
when starting Tails after January 3rd.

On top of that, a [[!tails_ticket 8449 desc="bug in *Tails Upgrader*"]]
prevents us from providing an automatic upgrade from version 1.2.1 to
1.2.2.

So all users should either:

  - Do a [[manual
upgrade|doc/first_steps/upgrade#manual]] to version 1.2.2 before January
3rd. (recommended)
  - Remember to do a manual upgrade to version 1.2.3 on January 14th.
