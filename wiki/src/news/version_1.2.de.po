"  * Minor improvements\n"
"    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.15, and isolate I2P traffic from the Tor\n"

"      option is added.\n"
"    - Make it clear that *TrueCrypt* will be removed in Tails 1.2.1\n"

"      volumes with `cryptsetup`.\n"
"    - Enable VirtualBox guest additions by default ([[!tails_ticket\n"
"      5730]]). In particular this enables VirtualBox's display\n"
"      management service.\n"
"    - Make the OTR status in Pidgin clearer thanks to the formatting\n"
"      toolbar ([[!tails_ticket 7356]]).\n"
"    - Upgrade syslinux to 6.03-pre20, which should fix UEFI boot on\n"
