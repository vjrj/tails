Our [[logo contest|logo_contest]] ended up [a few days
ago](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005390.html).
Since then, 11 regular Tails contributors voted on the [[36
proposals|blueprint/logo]].

Winner
======

The winning proposal is the one by [[Tchou|blueprint/logo#tchou]].

We commented on the initial version and we already came up with an improved
version:

Congratulations!

In the coming days we will keep on fine-tuning it and integrating it in time for
Tails 1.0. So don't hesitate to comment on it.

Six other great proposals made it to the top 7:

We reiterate our thanks to the 31 designers who worked for this contest to be
such a success.
