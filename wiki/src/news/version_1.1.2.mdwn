[[!tag announce]]

Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.1.2, is out.

This release fixes [[numerous security
issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.1.1]] and all users must
[[upgrade|doc/first_steps/upgrade]] as soon as possible.

We prepared this release mainly to fix a [[serious
flaw|https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/09/24/rsa-signature-forgery-in-nss/]]
in the Network Security Services (NSS) library used by Firefox and other
products allows attackers to create forged RSA certificates.

Before this release, users on a compromised network could be directed to sites
using a fraudulent certificate and mistake them for legitimate sites. This could
deceive them into revealing personal information such as usernames and
passwords. It may also deceive users into downloading malware if they believe
itâ€™s coming from a trusted site.

# Known issues

* The version of `tor` shipped in Tails 1.1.2 really is 0.2.4.24, *not*
  0.2.4.21 as reported in the logs and by `tor --version`. The reason
  is that the package was built with outdated files generated by
  `autogen.sh`, but this only affects the reported version, not the
  code.

* [[Longstanding|support/known_issues]] known issues.
