[[!meta title="Tails report for June and July, 2014"]]

Releases
========

  - Tails 1.1~beta1 was released on May 30.
  - Tails 1.0.1 was released on June 10.
  - Tails 1.1 was released on July 22. This marked our migration to Debian
    Wheezy and GNOME 3.

Metrics
=======

In June 2014:

   - Tails has been started more than 331 862 times in June.
     This makes 11 062 boots a day in average.
   - 25 124 downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO from our
     website.
   - 71 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

In July 2014:

   - Tails has been started more than 355 608 times in July.
     This makes 11 471 boots a day in average.
   - 35 134 downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO from our
     website.
   - 160 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.
     We discovered in late July than one of our WhisperBack relay was not
     sending emails anymore since our fixes of the Heartbleed bug. This
     explains the bump in the number of bug reports.
