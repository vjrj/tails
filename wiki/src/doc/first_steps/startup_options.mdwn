<a id="boot_menu"></a>

Using the <span class="application">boot menu</span>
====================================================

The <span class="application">boot menu</span> is the first screen to appears
when Tails starts.

<div class="tip">

The <span class="guilabel">failsafe</span> mode disables some features of the
kernel and might work better on some computers. You can try this option if you
think you are experiencing errors related to hardware compatibility while
starting Tails.

1.  To add a boot option, press <span class="keycap">Tab</span> when the
    <span class="application">boot menu</span> appears. A list of boot options
    appears at the bottom of the screen.

[[!img boot-menu-with-options.png link=no alt="Black screen with Debian live
artwork. 'Boot menu' with two options 'Live' and 'Live (failsafe)'. At the
bottom, a list of options ending with 'noautologin quiet_'"]]

2.  Press <span class="keycap">Space</span>, and type the boot option that you
    want to add.

    other, and separate them by a <span class="keycap">Space</span>.

<span class="button">Login</span> button, or just press
<span class="keycap">Enter</span>.

your country and keyboard layout. When you do that, <span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> itself
switches language.

Then click on the <span class="button">Forward</span> button.
