[[!meta title="Choosing between burning a DVD and installing onto a USB stick or SD card"]]

DVD
===

  - DVDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an attacker.
  - DVDs are cheap but you will need to burn a new DVD each time you update your version of Tails.
  - You could also use a DVD-RW but those are not read-only.

USB stick or SD card
====================

  - An attacker with physical access to your device or through a virus could
    alter your Tails.
  - USB sticks and SD cards can be upgraded to future versions of Tails.
  - You can use [[persistence|doc/first_steps/persistence]] and store your
    documents and configuration in an encrypted persistent volume on the same
    device.
  - USB sticks and SD cards are smaller to fit in your pocket.
  - Some older computers might not be able to start from a USB stick or SD card.
  - Some USB sticks, SD cards, or SD card adapters have a read-only switch that
    can prevent your Tails from being altered, but be aware that this protection
    is most probably not ensured by the device itself: do not rely on untrusted
    computers to respect this feature.
