Start GNOME Disk utility
========================

  1. Open <span class="application">GNOME Disk Utility</span> from the menu
     <span class="menuchoice">
       <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guimenuitem">Disk Utility</span>
     </span>.

Find out the device of the persistent volume
============================================

<span class="application">Disk Utility</span> lists all the current storage
devices in the left pane of the window. When you select one of these devices,
detailed information about it is displayed in the right pane: its partitions,
its brand, its size, etc.

  1. Find which device contains the persistent volume. It should have
     two partitions, one labelled <span class="guilabel">Tails</span>, and another
     one labelled <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span> which corresponds to the persistent volume.

  1. In the right pane of the window, verify that the device corresponds
     to your device, its brand, its size, etc.

Change the passphrase of the persistent volume
==============================================

  1. In the right pane, select the persistent volume partition, labelled <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span> by clicking on it.

  2. Click on <span class="guilabel">Change Passphrase</span>.

  3. Type your current passphrase and then type twice a new one.

  4. Finally click on <span class="guilabel">Change passphrase</span>.

  5. You now can restart Tails and try to enable the persistent volume
     with its new passphrase.
