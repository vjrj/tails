[[!meta title="Burning a DVD"]]

For detailed instructions on how to burn an ISO image under Linux, Windows or
Mac OSÂ X you can consult [the corresponding Ubuntu
documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto): just replace
the Ubuntu ISO image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded and ignore the part
on verifying the data integrity since you've already done that.
