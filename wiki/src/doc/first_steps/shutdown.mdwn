<div class="caution">

<p>This method might in rare occasions break the file system of your persistent
volume. <strong>Use this method only in case of emergency.</strong></p>

<p>Using the [[<span class="guilabel">read-only</span> option|persistence/use]]
of the persistent volume prevents this problem.</p>

<p>If you cannot enable persistence after using this method, you should be able
to recover most of your data by doing a [[file system check on the persistent
volume|persistence/check_file_system]].</p>
