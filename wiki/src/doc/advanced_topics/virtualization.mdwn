It is sometimes convenient to be able to run Tails without having to
restart your computer every time. This is possible using [virtual
machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).

With virtual machines, it is possible to run Tails inside a *host*
operating system (Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X). A virtual machine
emulates a real computers and its operating system, called *guest* which
appears in a window on the *host* operating system.

When running Tails in a virtual machine, you can use all the features of
Tails from your usual operating system and use both in parallel
without the need to restart the computer.

This is how Tails looks like when run in a virtual machine on Windows:

Security considerations
=======================

There are a few security issues with this approach though. 

When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
Tails.

The main issue is if the host operating system is compromised with a software
keylogger or other malware, which Tails does not provide any protection against
â€“ in fact, that is impossible.

Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.

As such, this is only recommended when the other alternative is not an option
or when you are absolutely sure that your host system is clean.

That's why Tails warns you when you are running it inside a virtual
machine. Do not expect Tails to protect you if you run it in a virtual
machine if you do not trust the host computer, Tails is not magical!

If you read this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual
machine: there could be a [[bug|support/found_a_problem]] in the
virtualization detection software Tails uses... or something really
weird is happening.

If you are unsure, and if you can afford it, run Tails from a DVD,
USB stick or SD card instead.
