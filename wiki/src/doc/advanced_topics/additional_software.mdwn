[[!meta title="Install new software"]]

Tails includes a
[[coherent but limited set of applications|doc/about/features]]. More
applications can be installed as on any Debian installation. Only
software packaged for Debian can be installed. To know if software
are packaged for Debian, you can search for them in
[[Debian packages webpage|https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages]].

Since Tails is amnesic, they need to be reinstalled for each working
session, unless you use the
[["Additional software" persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]].

In order to install new software, you need to:

- choose the
  [[administration password at startup|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]]
- in a terminal, type "sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get install $software"
(replace $software with the name of the package in Debian)

Software that use the network will need to be configured to go through Tor.

<div class="caution">
<p>
The software included in Tails go through testing, to make sure they
don't break the security features. Installing other software might
compromise the security that Tails provides, so you should be careful
with what you install.
