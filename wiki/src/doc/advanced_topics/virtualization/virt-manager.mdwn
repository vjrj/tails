[[!meta title="virt-manager"]]

[<span class="application">virt-manager</span>](http://virt-manager.org/) is a free software
virtualization solution for Linux. *virt-manager* has a more complex
interface than *VirtualBox* or *GNOME Boxes* but it also has a more
complete set of features.

Terminology
===========

*virt-manager* is based on a set of lower level virtualization tools,
going from the user interface to the hardware interactions with the
processor. This terminology is a bit confusing and other documentation
might mention the following tools:

  - *KVM* is the module of the Linux kernel that interacts with the
    virtualization features of the processor.
  - *QEMU* is the virtualization software that emulates virtual
    processors and peripherals based on *KVM* and that starts and stops
    virtual machines.
  - *libvirt* is a library that allows *virt-manager* to interact with
    the virtualization capabilities provides by *QEMU*.
  - *SPICE* is a protocol that allows to visualize the desktop of
    virtual machines.
  - *virt-manager* is the graphical interface that allows to create,
    configure, and run virtual machines.

Installation
============

To install *virt-manager* in Debian or Ubuntu, execute the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install virt-manager libvirt-daemon-system

Running Tails from an ISO image
===============================

  1. Start *virt-manager*.
  1. Double-click on **localhost (QEMU)** to connect to the *QEMU*
     system of your host.
  1. To create a new virtual machine, choose
     <span class="menuchoice"> <span
     class="guimenu">File</span>&nbsp;▸ <span
     class="guimenuitem">New Virtual Machine</span></span>.
  1. In *step 1*, choose **Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)**.
  1. In *step 2*, choose:
     - **Use ISO image**, then **Browse...**, and **Browse Local** to
       browse for the ISO image that you want to start from.
     - **OS type**: **Linux**.
     - **Version**: **Debian Wheezy**.
  1. In *step 3*, allocate at least 1024 MB of RAM.
  1. In *step 4*, disable storage for this virtual machine.
  1. In *step 5*:
     - Type a name for the new virtual machine.
     - Click **Finish** to start the virtual machine.

If you get the error message "<span class="guilabel">Error starting
domain: Requested operation is not valid: network 'default' is not
active</span>", then try to start the default virtual network:

<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="guilabel">localhost (QEMU)</span>.</li>
<li>Choose <span class="menuchoice">
    <span class="guimenu">Edit</span>&nbsp;▸

<li>Click on <span class="guilabel">Virtual Networks</span> tab, then
    select the <span class="guilabel">default</span> virtual network in
    the left pane.</li>
<li>Click on the [[!img media-playback-start.png alt="Start Network"
    link=no class=symbolic]] icon on the bottom of the left pane to
    start the default virtual network.</li>
</ol>

Running Tails from a USB stick or SD card
=========================================

To run Tails from a USB stick or SD card using *virt-manager*, first
create a virtual machine running from an ISO image as described
[[above|virt-manager#iso]].

Then do the following:

  1. From the virtual machine window, choose
     <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Virtual Machine</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenuitem">Shut Down</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Force Off</span></span> to shut down the
     virtual machine.
  1. Plug in the USB stick or insert the SD card from which you want to
     run Tails.
  1. Choose
     <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">View</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Details</span></span> to edit the
     configuration of the virtual machine.
  1. Click on the **Add Hardware** button on the bottom of the left
     pane.
  1. Select **USB Host Device** in the left pane.
  1. In the right pane, click on the device from which you want to run
     Tails, and click **Finish**.

You can keep the original ISO image connected as a virtual DVD to
install Tails onto the USB stick or SD card if needed.

<a id="disconnect"></a>

You can also disconnect the original ISO image and start directly from the
USB stick once Tails is already installed on it. To do so:

  1. Shut down the virtual machine.
  1. In the configuration of the virtual machine, click on **IDE CDROM
     1** in the left pane.
  1. Click on the **Disconnect** button in the right pane.
  1. To enable the USB stick or SD card as a boot option:
     1. Click on **Boot Options** in the left pane.
     1. Select the **USB** boot option corresponding to your USB device.
     1. Click **Apply**.
  1. To start the virtual machine choose
     <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">View</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Console</span></span> and then
     <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Virtual Machine</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Run</span></span>.

Once you started from the USB device you can [[create a persistent
volume|first_steps/persistence/configure]] on it.

Running Tails from a virtual USB storage
========================================

You can also run Tails from a virtual USB storage, saved as a single
file on the host operating system.

To run Tails from a virtual USB device using *virt-manager*, first
create a virtual machine running from an ISO image as described
[[above|virt-manager#iso]].

Then do the following to create a virtual USB storage:

  1. From the virtual machine window, choose
     <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Virtual Machine</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenuitem">Shut Down</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Force Off</span></span> to shut down the
     virtual machine.
  1. Choose
     <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">View</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Details</span></span> to edit the
     configuration of the virtual machine.
  1. Click on the **Add Hardware** button on the bottom of the left
     pane.
  1. Select **Storage** in the left pane.
  1. In the right pane, change the **Bus type** to USB and click
     **Finish**.
  1. Select **USB Disk 1** in the left pane.
  1. In the right pane, select the **Removable** option and click
     **Apply**.

Then start the virtual machine from the virtual DVD to install Tails
onto the virtual USB storage. The virtual USB storage appears in *Tails
Installer* as **QEMU HARDDISK**.

After that you can disconnect the original ISO image and start directly
from the virtual USB stick [[as described
in the previous section|virt-manager#disconnect]].

Once you started from the virtual USB device you can [[create a persistent
volume|first_steps/persistence/configure]] on it.
