[[!meta title="Virt-manager"]]

<span class="application">Virt-manager</span> is a free software
virtualization solution for Linux. *Virt-manager* has a more complex
interface than *VirtualBox* or *GNOME Boxes* but it also has a more
complete set of features.

Terminology
===========

*Virt-manager* is based on a set of lower level virtualization tools,
going from the user interface to the hardware interactions with the
processor. This terminology is a bit confusing and other documentation
might mention the following tools:

  - *KVM* is the module of the Linux kernel that interacts with the
    virtualization features of the processor.
  - *QEMU* is the virtualization software that emulates virtual
    processors and peripherals based on *KVM* and that starts and stops
    virtual machines.
  - *libvirt* is a library that allows *Virt-manager* to interact with
    the virtualization capabilities provides by *QEMU*.
  - *SPICE* is a protocol that allows to visualize the desktop of
    virtual machines.
  - *Virt-manager* is the graphical interface that allows to create,
    configure, and run virtual machines.

Running Tails from an ISO image
===============================

  1. Start *Virt-manager*.
  1. Double-click on **locahost (QEMU)** to connect to the *QEMU*
     system of your host.
  1. To create a new virtual machine, choose
     <span class="menuchoice"> <span
     class="guimenu">File</span>&nbsp;▸ <span
     class="guimenuitem">New Virtual Machine</span></span>.
  1. In *step 1*, choose **Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)**.

     - **Version**: **Debian Wheezy**.
  1. In *step 3*, allocate at least 1024 MB of RAM.
  1. In *step 4*, disable storage for this virtual machine.
  1. In *step 5*:
     - Type a name for the new virtual machine.
     - Click on the **Finish** button to start the virtual machine.

active</span>", then try to start the default virtual network:

<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="guilabel">localhost (QEMU)</span>.</li>
<li>Choose <span class="menuchoice">
    <span class="guimenu">Edit</span>&nbsp;▸
    <span class="guimenuitem">Connection details</span></span> to
    administer the connection to your local
    <span class="application">QEMU</span> system.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="guilabel">Virtual Networks</span> tab, then
    select the <span class="guilabel">default</span> virtual network in
    the left pane.</li>
<li>Click on the [[!img media-playback-start.png alt="Start Network"
    link=no class=symbolic]] icon on the bottom of the left pane to
    start the default virtual network.</li>
