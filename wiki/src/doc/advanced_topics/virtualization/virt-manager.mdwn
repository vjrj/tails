[[!meta title="Virt-manager"]]

<span class="application">Virt-manager</span> is a free software
virtualization solution for Linux. *Virt-manager* has a more complex
interface than *VirtualBox* or *GNOME Boxes* but it also has a more
complete set of features.

*Virt-manager* is based on a set of lower level virtualization tools,
going from the user interface to the hardware interactions with the
processor. This terminology is a bit confusing and other documentation
might mention the following tools:

  - *KVM* is the module of the Linux kernel that interacts with the
    virtualization features of the processor.
  - *QEMU* is the virtualization software that emulates virtual
    processors and peripherals based on *KVM* and that starts and stops
    virtual machines.
  - *libvirt* is a library that allows *Virt-manager* to interact with
    the virtualization capabilities provides by *QEMU*.
  - *SPICE* is a protocol that allows to visualize the desktop of
    virtual machines.
  - *Virt-manager* is the graphical interface that allows to create,
    configure, and run virtual machines.
