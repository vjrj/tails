[[!meta title="VirtualBox"]]

It is possible to run Tails in a virtual machine using [<span
class="application">VirtualBox</span>](http://virtualbox.org/) from a
Windows or Linux host operating system.

<span class="application">VirtualBox</span> is proprietary software
but it also has an open source edition.

<div class="caution">

For security reasons, we recommend you to use the open source edition,
though it lacks support for USB devices.

Security considerations for Windows
===================================

In our [[security warnings about
virtualization|virtualization#security]] we recommend to run Tails in
a virtual machine only if the host operating system is trustworthy.

<div class="caution">

Microsoft Windows being proprietary software, it cannot be considered
trustworthy. Only run Tails in a virtual machine on Windows for testing
purposes and do not rely on it for security.
