[[!meta title="VirtualBox"]]

It is possible to run Tails in a virtual machine using [<span
class="application">VirtualBox</span>](http://virtualbox.org/) from a
Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X host operating system.

<span class="application">VirtualBox</span> has a free software version,
called <span class="application">VirtualBox Open Source Edition</span>
and some proprietary components, for example to add support for USB
devices.

<div class="caution">

For security reasons, we recommend you to use only the <span class="application">Open Source Edition</span>,
though it does not allow to use a persistent volume.

Security considerations for Windows and Mac OS X
================================================

In our [[security warnings about
virtualization|virtualization#security]] we recommend to run Tails in
a virtual machine only if the host operating system is trustworthy.

<div class="caution">

Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X being proprietary software, they cannot be considered
trustworthy. Only run Tails in a virtual machine on Windows or OS X for testing
purposes and do not rely on it for security.
