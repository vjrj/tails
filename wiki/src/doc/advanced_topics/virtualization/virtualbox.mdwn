[[!meta title="VirtualBox"]]

It is possible to run Tails in a virtual machine using [<span
class="application">VirtualBox</span>](https://www.virtualbox.org/) from a
Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X host operating system.

<span class="application">VirtualBox</span> has a free software version,
called <span class="application">VirtualBox Open Source Edition</span>
and some proprietary components, for example to add support for USB
devices.

<div class="caution">

For security reasons, we recommend you to use only the <span class="application">Open Source Edition</span>,
though it does not allow to use a persistent volume.

<div class="tip">

<p>With the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders">
<span class="guilabel">shared folders</span></a> feature of
<span class="application">VirtualBox</span> you can access files of your
host system from within the guest system.</p>

Security considerations for Windows and Mac OS X
================================================

In our [[security warnings about
virtualization|virtualization#security]] we recommend to run Tails in
a virtual machine only if the host operating system is trustworthy.

<div class="caution">

Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X being proprietary software, they cannot be considered
trustworthy. Only run Tails in a virtual machine on Windows or OS X for testing
purposes and do not rely on it for security.

   <div class="bug"><p><span class="application">VirtualBox</span> guest
   modules allow for additional features when using Tails in a virtual
   machine: shared folders, resizable display, shared clipboard, etc.</p>

   <p>But due to <a hreg="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11037">a bug in
   <span class="application">VirtualBox</span></a>, the resizable display
   and shared clipboard only work in Tails if the virtual machine is to
   have a 32-bit processor. The shared folders work both on 32-bit and
   64-bit guests.</p></div>
