[[!meta title="Manage passwords with KeePassX"]]

Using the [<span class="application">KeePassX</span>](https://www.keepassx.org/)
password manager you can:

  - Store many passwords in an encrypted database which is protected by
    a single passphrase of your choice.
  - Always use different and stronger passwords, since you only have to
    remember a single passphrase to unlock the entire database.
  - Generate very strong random passwords.

Use <span class="application">KeePassX</span> to type a password into <span class="application">Pinentry</span>
===============================================================================================================

When using <span class="application">OpenPGP</span> with <span
class="application">Claws Mail</span> or <span class="application">OpenPGP
Applet</span> for example, you need to enter a password in a <span
class="application">Pinentry</span> dialog box. But you cannot copy and
paste into it. This is a security feature of <span
class="application">Pinentry</span> based on the fact that otherwise the
data in the clipboard could be accessed by another application against
your will.

Use the <span class="guilabel">AutoType</span> feature of <span
class="application">KeePassX</span> to type a password into a <span
class="application">Pinentry</span> dialog box.

0. Before the <span class="application">Pinentry</span> dialog box
appears, [[open <span class="application">KeePassX</span> and unlock the
database|manage_passwords#restore]].

0. Use <span class="application">OpenPGP</span> with <span
class="application">Claws Mail</span> or <span class="application">OpenPGP
Applet</span> until the <span class="application">Pinentry</span> dialog
box appears.

0. Click on the <span class="application">KeePassX</span> logo in the
notification area to switch to <span class="application">KeePassX</span>.
Right-click on the entry from which you want to
use the password, and choose <span class="guilabel">Perform
AutoType</span>.

<div class="note">

Do not enter a user name in the <span
class="application">KeePassX</span> entry, otherwise <span
class="application">KeePassX</span> will type it together with the
password in the <span class="application">Pinentry</span> dialog box,
and the resulting password will be incorrect.
