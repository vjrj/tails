[[!meta title="Sharing encrypted secrets using keyringer"]]

<span class="application">[Keyringer](https://keyringer.pw/)</span> is
an encrypted and distributed secret sharing software running from the
command line.

<span class="application">Keyringer</span> lets you manage and share
secrets using OpenPGP and [Git](http://git-scm.com/) with custom
commands to encrypt, decrypt, and edit text files and other kind of
documents. By storing those secrets in Git, you can share them with
other people in a distributed manner.

<div class="note">

<p>Using <span class="application">keyringer</span> requires previous
knowledge of Git and the command line.</span>

</div>

To learn how to use *keyringer*, read the [documentation on the
*keyringer* website](https://keyringer.pw/).

<div class="tip">

<p>You can use the <span class="guilabel">open</span> command of
<span class="application">keyringer</span> to edit, encrypt, and
share <span class="application">LibreOffice</span> documents,
images, etc.</p>

</div>

To store your *keyringer* configuration across separate working
sessions, you can enable the [[<span class="guilabel">Dotfiles</span>
persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#dotfiles]]
and make persistent the files in the <span
class="filename">.keyringer</span> folder of your
<span class="filename">Home</span> folder.

For example, if you have a single keyringer named **top-secret**:

    /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles
    └── .keyringer
        ├── config
        └── top-secret

Make sure to update your *dotfiles* each time you use the **init**,
**teardown**, **destroy**, or **preferences** command of *keyringer*.

To do so you can execute the following command:

    rsync -v --archive --delete ~/.keyringer /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/
