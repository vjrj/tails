[[!meta title="Create and use encrypted volumes"]]

The simplest way to carry around the documents you want to use with Tails and
make sure that they haven't been accessed nor modified is to store them in an
encrypted volume: a dedicated partition on a USB stick or an external hard-disk.

Tails comes with utilities for LUKS, a standard for disk-encryption under Linux. 

  - The GNOME <span class="application">Disk Utility</span>, allows you to
    create encrypted volumes.
  - The GNOME desktop, allows you to open encrypted volumes.

<div class="tip">

<p>To store encrypted files on a Tails device, it is recommended to create a
[[persistent volume|first_steps/persistence]] instead.</p>

</div>

<div class="note">

<p>[[Administration
privileges|first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]] are required to
modify the list of partitions on the USB stick or SD card from which Tails is
running.</p>

Create an encrypted partition
=============================

To open the GNOME <span class="application">Disk Utility</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Disk Utility</span></span>.

<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Identify your external storage device</h2>

<span class="application">Disk Utility</span> lists all the current storage
devices on the left side of the screen.

  1. Plug in the external storage device that you want to use.

  1. A new device appears in the list of storage devices. Click on it:

     [[!img storage_devices_after.png link=no alt="A new storage device appeared
     in the list"]]

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Format the device</h2>

  1. Check that the description of the device on the right side of the screen
  corresponds to your device: its brand, its size, etc.

  1. Click on <span class="guilabel">Format Drive</span> to erase all the
  existing partitions on the device.

  1. In the dialog box to select the <span class="guilabel">Scheme</span>, if
  you are unsure, leave the default option <span class="guilabel">Master Boot
  Record</span> selected.

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Create a new encrypted partition</h2>

Now the schema of the partitions in the middle of the screen shows an empty
device.

[[!img empty_device.png link=no alt="Free 3.9 GB"]]

  1. Click on <span class="guilabel">Create Partition</span>.

  1. Configure the new partition:

     [[!img create_partition.png link=no alt="Create partition on…"]]

    - <span class="guilabel">Size</span>. You can decide to create a partition
      on the whole device or just on part of it. In this example we are creating
      a partition of 2.0 GB on a device of 3.9 GB.
    - <span class="guilabel">Type</span>. You can change the file system type of
      the partition. If you are not sure you can leave the default value:
      <span class="guilabel">Ext4</span>.
    - <span class="guilabel">Name</span>. You can set a name for the partition.
      This name remains invisible until the partition is open but can help
      you to identify it during use.
    - <span class="guilabel">Encrypt underlying device</span>. Select this
      option to encrypt the partition.

    Then click on the <span class="button">Create</span> button.

  1. Enter a passphrase for the new partition in the
     <span class="guilabel">Enter passphrase</span> dialog box. Then click on
     the <span class="button">Create</span> button.

  1. Creating the partition takes from a few seconds to a few minutes. After
     that, the new encrypted partition appears in the volumes of the device:

     [[!img encrypted_partition.png link=no alt="Encrypted 2.0 GB / secret 2.0 GB ext4"]]

  1. At this point you can create other partitions in the free space left on the
     device, if you want, by clicking on it and doing again
     <span class="guilabel">Create Partition</span>.

<h2 class="bullet-number-four">Use the new partition</h2>

You can access this new volume from the <span class="guimenu">Places</span> menu
with the name you gave it.

[[!img places_secret.png link=no alt="Places&nbsp;▸ secret"]]

Open an existing encrypted partition
====================================

When plugging a device containing an encrypted partition, Tails does not mount it
automatically but it appears in the <span class="guimenu">Places</span>
menu. If several partitions appear as <span class="guimenu">Encrypted</span>,
like in the example, you can use its size to guess which one is the one you want
to open.

[[!img places_encrypted.png link=no alt="Places&nbsp;▸ 2.0 GB Encrypted"]]

Once you are done using the device, to close the encrypted partition choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Computer</span></span>,
right-click on the device, and select <span class="guilabel">Safely
Remove Drive</span>.
