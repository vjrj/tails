[[!meta title="Your data won't be saved unless explicitly asked"]]

As stated in the [[about]] page, Tails is designed to leave no trace on the
computer you're using unless you ask it explicitly. It is important
to understand some of the consequences of that.

Starting a computer on a media containing Tails doesn't change anything on the
operating system actually installed on your hard disk: as a live system, Tails
doesn't need to use your hard disk during the whole session. Be your hard disk absent
or damaged, it wouldn't prevent your computer to start Tails. Consequently,
removing the DVD or USB stick containing Tails is enough to retrieve your usual
operating system.

You should save anything you want to keep for later access into a
separate device (other USB stick, other DVD or any device you would choose),
or use the [[persistence feature|first_steps/persistence]].

Accessing internal hard disks
=============================

<div class="caution">

<p>Accessing internal disks of the computer includes some risks: you
can leave traces of your activities in Tails on the hard disks; if
Tails is compromised, this creates risks for your usual operating
system; and if an application is compromised, this can lead to
de-anonymisation.</p>

</div>

To access internal hard disks, you need to select the
[[administration password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/]]
startup option, then open the Nautilus files manager and click on the
desired hard disk on the left panel.

<div class="caution">

<p>If your usual operating system is in
hibernation, accessing it might create problems. Only access your disk
if your system was shut down properly.</p>

<p>If your usual operating system uses LVM (Logical Volume Manager),
the procedure to access it is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In GNU/Linux systems, if your user is not the number 1000, the
procedure to access it is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In all cases, you might encounter permissions problems.</p>
