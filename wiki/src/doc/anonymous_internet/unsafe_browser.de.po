"Many publicly accessible Internet connections (usually available through a "
"wireless network connection) require its users to register and login in "
"order to get access to the Internet. This include both free and paid for "
"services that may be found at Internet cafés, libraries, airports, hotels, "
"universities etc. Normally in these situations, a so called *captive portal* "
"intercepts any website request made and redirects the web browser to a login "
"page. None of that works when Tor is used, so a browser with unrestricted "
"network access is necessary."
