[[!meta title="Email with Claws Mail"]]

For reading and writing email, Tails includes <span
class="application">[Claws Mail](http://www.claws-mail.org/)</span>.

For detailed documentation, refer to the
[official <span class="application">Claws Mail</span> user guide](http://www.claws-mail.org/documentation.php?section=general).

You can configure
[[a persistence volume|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/]] to
remember your email settings.

When the
[[<span class="guilabel">Claws Mail</span> persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#claws_mail]]
is activated, the configuration and emails stored locally by the <span
class="application">Claws Mail</span> email client are saved in the
persistent volume.

All the configuration options are available from the graphical interface. There
is no need to manually edit or overwrite the configuration files.

<div class="bug">

<p>The emails of a POP3 account created without using the
configuration assistant are not stored in the persistent volume by
default. For example, when configuring a second email account.</p>

<p>To make it persistent choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">File</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenu">Add Mailbox</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">MH...</span></span> and change the location of the mailbox
from <span class="filename">Mail</span> to <span class="filename">.claws-mail/Mail</span>.</p>

</div>

Please note that Tails will
[migrate to Icedove](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5663) at some
point.

Email providers
===============

We do not recommend any third-party services for your private
communication, be it email, instant messaging or any other kind of
messaging. We consider that it is not the aim of Tails to provide such
information. However, the Riseup collective provides a
[list of autonomous servers](https://help.riseup.net/en/security/resources/radical-servers).
Furthermore, we encourage you to run your own, independent, services.
