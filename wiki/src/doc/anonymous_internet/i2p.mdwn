[[!meta title="Using I2P"]]

[I2P](https://geti2p.net/) is an alternative anonymity network to Tor
which supports most common Internet activities like web browsing,
email, filesharing etc. Unlike Tor, whose main focus arguably is on
accessing sites from the "normal" Internet, I2P is more oriented
towards being a closed [[!wikipedia darknet]], separate from the
"normal" Internet. Any one running I2P can run an anonymous server, a
so called Eepsite, that is only accessible within I2P using the `.i2p`
top level domain (similar to `.onion` for Tor hidden services). For
instance, the I2P homepage can also be accessed through I2P via
<http://i2p-projekt.i2p>.

Starting I2P
============

*I2P* is not enabled by default when Tails starts. To start I2P, add the <span
class="command">i2p</span> boot option to the <span class="application">boot
menu</span>. For detailed instructions, see the documentation on
[[using the <span class="application">boot menu</span>|first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

When added to the boot options, *I2P* will be started automatically once the time has been synchronized.
Unlike previous versions of Tails, the router console will not be opened automatically.

The I2P router console can be accessed from within *I2P Browser*. From the
desktop, choose <span class="menuchoice">
       <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guimenuitem">I2P Browser</span></span>.

The router console shows I2P's current status, links to many useful I2P resources
(forums, email, filesharing, etc.) and offers the possibility to
shutdown I2P. Starting with Tails 1.2, `.i2p` addresses are only accessible
from within I2P Browser. Internet resources cannot be reached from within I2P
Browser.
