Email providers
===============

We do not recommend any third-party services for your private
communication, be it email, instant messaging or any other kind of
messaging. We consider that it is not the aim of Tails to provide such
information. However, the Riseup collective provides a [list of
autonomous
servers](https://help.riseup.net/en/security/resources/radical-servers).
Furthermore, we encourage you to run your own, independent, services.
