"[HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) is a Firefox "
"extension shipped in Tails and produced as a collaboration between [The Tor "
"Project](https://torproject.org/) and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation]"
"(https://eff.org/). It encrypts your communications with a number of major "
"websites. Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption "
"over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to "
"unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the "
"unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by "
"rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS."
