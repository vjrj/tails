<span class="application">NetworkManager</span> allows you to connect to a local
network using a wired or wireless connection (Wi-Fi, 3G, or GSM):

  - If a wired connection is detected,
    <span class="application">NetworkManager</span> automatically connects to
    it.
  - To connect to a wireless connection, click on the
    <span class="application">NetworkManager Applet</span> to see the list of
    available connections. Then select the one you want to connect to.

After establishing a connection to a local network:

  a. If you can already access the Internet, Tor and
     <span class="application">[[Vidalia]]</span> are automatically started.
  b. If you need to log in to a captive portal before being granted access to
     the Internet, then [[see the corresponding documentation|unsafe_browser]].

If you want to reuse your custom <span class="application">NetworkManager</span>
configuration or the passwords of encrypted wireless connections across separate
working sessions, you can activate the [[<span class="guilabel">Network connections</span> persistence
feature|first_steps/persistence/configure#network_connections]].

If you are concerned about being identified as a Tails user on your local
network, read our documentation about [[network
fingerprinting|doc/about/fingerprint]].
