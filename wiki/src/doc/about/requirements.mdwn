[[!meta title="System requirements"]]

Tails should work on any reasonably recent computer, say manufactured after 2005.
Here is a detailed list of requirements:

- Either **an internal or external DVD reader** or the possibility to **boot from a USB stick or SD card**.
- Tails requires an <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia x86]]</span>
  compatible processor: **<span class="definition">[[!wikipedia
  IBM_PC_compatible]]</span>** and others but not <span
  class="definition">[[!wikipedia PowerPC]]</span> nor <span
  class="definition">[[!wikipedia ARM]]</span>. Mac computers are IBM PC
  compatible since 2006.
- **1 GB of RAM** to work smoothly. Tails is known to work with less memory
  but you might experience strange behaviours or crashes.
