To prevent cold-boot attacks and various memory forensics, Tails
erases memory on shutdown and when the boot media is physically
removed.

Multilingual support
====================

One can choose at boot time between a big number of languages.

The required keyboard input system is automatically enabled.

Some of these languages could not be thoroughly tested as we don't
speak every language in the world. If you find issues using one of the
supposedly supported languages, don't hesitate to [[tell us about
it|support]]. E.g. Tails probably lacks some non-Latin fonts
or input systems.

If you wish to make it easier to use Tails for your language speakers,
see the [[translators guidelines|contribute/how/translate]].
