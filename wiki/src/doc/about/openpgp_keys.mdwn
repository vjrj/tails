[[!meta title="OpenPGP keys"]]

Tails developers maintain several OpenPGP key pairs.

[[!toc levels=2]]

<a id="private"></a>

Private mailing-list key
========================

Purpose
-------

### Encryption

This key has an encryption subkey. Please use it to encrypt email sent
to the core developers encrypted mailing-list: <tails@boum.org>.

### Signature

This key also has the capability to sign and certify. Until Tails
0.5 and 0.6~rc3, released images were signed by this key. This purpose
is now deprecated: further releases will be signed by a dedicated,
safer signing key. As of 2010 October 7th, our mailing-list key
signature only means our mailing-list software checked the signed
content was originally OpenPGP-signed by a Tails core developer.

Policy
------

The secret key material and its passphrase are stored on the server
that runs our encrypted mailing-list software and on systems managed
by core Tails developers.

This means people other than Tails developers are in a position to
use this secret key. Tails developers trust these people enough to
rely on them for running our encrypted mailing-list, but still: this
key pair is managed in a less safe way than our signing key.

Signing key
===========

Purpose
-------

This key only has the capability to sign and certify: it has no
encryption subkey.

Its only purpose is:

- to sign Tails released images;
- to certify other cryptographic public keys needed for Tails
  development.

Policy
------

The secret key material will never be stored on an online server or on
systems managed by anyone else than Tails core developers.

### Master key

* No single individual has permanent access to the full master key.
* Used only offline, in an airgapped Tails, with only interfaces:
  - plugging removable storage to send to the outside world whatever
    is needed (public key, secret key stubs, parts of the secret
    master key, etc.)
  - plugging removable storage to receive from the outside world
    whatever is needed (Debian packages, public keys, etc.)
  - plugging into another running operating system to install Tails
* The expiration date is in no more than one year, and may be bumped
  as many times as we find it reasonable.

### Signing subkeys

* Stored on OpenPGP smartcards owned by those who need it.
* Expiration date: same as the subkey.

How to get the public key?
--------------------------

There are multiple ways to get this OpenPGP public key:

  - download it from this website: [[!tails_website tails-signing.key]]
  - fetch it from your favourite keyserver.

If you already have Tails signing key but download it again, it can update the
list of existing signatures of the key.

<a id="support"></a>

User support key
================

Purpose
-------

### Encryption

  - Use this key to encrypt private support requests sent to <tails-support-private@boum.org>.
  - This same key is used to handle [[*WhisperBack* reports|first_steps/bug_reporting]].

Policy
------

The secret key material and its passphrase are stored on the server
that runs our encrypted mailing-list software and on systems managed
by core Tails developers.
