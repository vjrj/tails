[[!meta title="OpenPGP keys"]]

Tails developers maintain several OpenPGP key pairs.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Mailing-list key
================

Purpose
-------

### Encryption

This key has an encryption subkey. Please use it to encrypt email sent
to the core developers encrypted mailing-list: <tails@boum.org>.

### Signature

This key also has the capability to sign and certify. Until Tails
0.5 and 0.6~rc3, released images were signed by this key. This purpose
is now deprecated: further releases will be signed by a dedicated,
safer signing key. As of 2010 October 7th, our mailing-list key
signature only means our mailing-list software checked the signed
content was originally OpenPGP-signed by a Tails core developer.

Policy
------

The secret key material and its passphrase are stored on the server
that runs our encrypted mailing-list software and on systems managed
by core Tails developers.

This means people other than Tails developers are in a position to
use this secret key. Tails developers trust these people enough to
rely on them for running our encrypted mailing-list, but still: this
key pair is managed in a less safe way than our signing key.

How to get the public key?
--------------------------

There are multiple ways to get this OpenPGP public key:

- download it from this website: [[!tails_website tails-email.key]]

Signing key
===========

Purpose
-------

This key only has the capability to sign and certify: it has no
encryption subkey.

Its only purpose is:

- to sign Tails released images (starting with 0.6)
- to certify other cryptographic public keys needed for Tails
  development.

Policy
------

The secret key material will never be stored on an online server or on
systems managed by anyone else than Tails core developers.
