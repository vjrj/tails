# Minimize the delta!

## That is?

* diverge by the smallest possible amount from upstream
* especially from Debian
* Tails is mostly glue around existing code

## Why?

* maintainability
* sharing our work with the rest of the Free Software community

## Does it work?

* 5 years later, Tails is still alive
* less modified packages in Tails/Wheezy than in Tails/Squeeze
* will be even better in Tails/Jessie
* in 2014, at least 7 Tails contributors have contributed to Debian

# Tracking Debian bugs affecting Tails

## Debian Bug tracking system

* Debian's tracker for problems and tasks:  
  <https://bugs.debian.org/>
* email-based interface
* package-centric but some distribution-wide features

## usertags

We use usertags:

* user = <tails-dev@boum.org>
* tags: whatever we need, that's our namespace  
  (e.g. `crypto-gui`, `hardening`, `im`)
* all our usertagged bugs:  
  <https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/bts-usertags.cgi?user=tails-dev@boum.org>
* documentation: <https://wiki.debian.org/bugs.debian.org/usertags>

## Redmine

Tails work that needs to be done in Debian:

# How can I help?

## Help maintain backports

* we use a lot of backports
* e.g. poedit, shared-mime-info, libvirt, qemu, redmine, monkeysign
* we could use more, e.g. the Xorg stack

## Help maintain packages

* mat
* libgsecuredelete and nautilus-wipe
* OTR-related packages: <https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/OTR>
* anonymity-related packages:
  <https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/AnonymityTools>
* anything else Tails relies upon, e.g. GNOME
* anything else our infrastructure uses, e.g. libvirt/qemu, Jenkins,
  ruby-rjb

## Help with distribution-wide improvements

* AppArmor support: <https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor>
* Reproducible builds: <https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds>
* Hardening: <https://wiki.debian.org/HardeningWalkthrough>
* Keep Debian Live development branches good enough for our needs,
  e.g. via automated testing.
* Keep Debian awesome.
