Current Tails' challenges
=========================

Cadence & popularity
--------------------

- new release every 6 weeks
- about 10k boots a day, doubles every year

Limited resources and time
--------------------------

- mostly volunteer work
- 2800 commits, by ~15 persons, in the last 6 months

Energy-draining release process
-------------------------------

- automated test suite, but:
- still huge manual test suite
- no way to freeze the APT repositories we are using

Roadmap
=======

Tails 2.0
---------

* sustainability and maintainability: lots of continuous integration
  and infrastructure work
* Greeter revamp
* Icedove (Thunderbird)
* support more download mirrors
* nicer initial download and installation process

<https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=130>

Tails 3.0
---------

* more hardening, more sandboxing
* multi-platform installer

<https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=160>

More?
-----

* port to Debian Jessie: WIP, must be finished in 2015
* <https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap>

What we have
============

People
------

*very* few people involved in continuous integration and
infrastructure work

Services
--------

* Jenkins:  
  ISO images from major branches built after Git push  
  PO files sanity checks  
  thanks to jenkins.debian.net for the inspiration!
* APT repository
* rsync, Bitcoin, BitTorrent, etc.

Needed infrastructure improvements
==================================

Release process
---------------

* building Debian packages
* building ISO images
* freezing for real

Quality assurance
-----------------

* does our stuff stop building?
* does our stuff stop working?
* does new stuff break anything?
* notifications, integration with the review process
* some day, gatekeeping?

Security
--------

* deterministic (reproducible) builds
* hardening build flags status
* same-day security updates

Internal communication
----------------------

* commit notifications
* package upload notifications

Tails system administrators
===========================

Goals
-----

The Tails system administrators set up and maintain the infrastructure
that supports the development and operations of Tails, to:

* make the life of Tails contributors easier
* improve the quality of the Tails releases

## Principles

* Infrastructure as code
* Free Software
* Relationships with upstream

## Infrastructure as code

We want to treat system administration like a (free) software
development project.

## Infrastructure as code: why?

* enabling people to participate without accounts on our servers
* reviewing changes applied to our systems
* being able to reproduce our systems via automatic deployment
* sharing knowledge with other people

## Infrastructure as code: how?

* publish as much as possible of our systems configuration
* manage our whole infrastructure with configuration management tools

## Free Software

* [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)
* exception: firmware needed by our hardware

## Relationships with upstream

<https://tails.boum.org/contribute/relationship_with_upstream/>

## Tools

* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux
* [Puppet](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to host and deploy configuration,
  including our Puppet modules

How to help?
============

## Entry points

* <https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/sysadmin/>
* <https://tails.boum.org/contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins/>
* "easy" tasks

## Where to start?

* &#35;6295: Evaluate consequences of importing large amounts of packages into reprepro
* &#35;6891: Monitor broken links on our website
* &#35;6918: Track hardening status of the binaries shipped in Tails
* &#35;7427: Evaluate using aptly
* &#35;7125: Write a Puppet class to manage a Tails mirror
* &#35;5894: APT repository: notify incoming
