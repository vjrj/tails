Collective matters
==================

Our starting point
------------------

privacy and anonymity: collective matters

Usability
---------

⇒ privacy and anonymity tools must be usable  
by a *broad* audience

Mutual aid
----------

* social installation and upgrade process
* local collectives provide support to users
* local collectives provide feedback to the project

Inclusive project
-----------------

* not purely a project with (political) friends
