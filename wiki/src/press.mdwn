* 2014-04-14: In the [press
  conference](http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2014/4/11/video_glenn_greenwald_laura_poitras_q)
  she held after winning a Polk Award for her reporting on Edward Snowden and
  the NSA, Laura Poitras said "We just published a blog about a tool that's
  called Tails, which is a operating system that runs on either USB stick or SD
  disc, that is a sort of all-in-one encryption tool that you can use for PGP
  and encryption. And it's just really secure. [...] So, it's a really important
  tool for journalists."

  NSA](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa)
  by Trevor Timm:
  - Laura Poitras says: "I've been reluctant to go into details about
    the different steps I took to communicate securely with Snowden to
    avoid those methods being targeted. Now that Tails gives a green
    light, I can say it has been an essential tool for reporting the
    NSA story. It is an all-in-one secure digital communication system
    (GPG email, OTR chat, Tor web browser, encrypted storage) that is
    small enough to swallow. I'm very thankful to the Tails developers
    for building this tool."
  - Glenn Greenwald says: "Tails have been vital to my ability to work
    securely on the NSA story. The more I've come to learn about
    communications security, the more central Tails has become to
    my approach."
  - Barton Gellman says: "Privacy and encryption work, but it's too
    easy to make a mistake that exposes you. Tails puts the essential
    tools in one place, with a design that makes it hard to screw them
    up. I could not have talked to Edward Snowden without this kind of
    protection. I wish I'd had it years ago."

  Trevor Timm from Freedom of the Press Foundation explains that Tails « has
  been vital for most, if not all, of the NSA journalists. [...] Its prime use
  case is journalists trying to communicate or work in environments in which
  they may normally be at risk or compromised. The NSA stories have been the
  biggest story in journalism in the past decade, yet the tool the reporters
  rely on is incredibly underfunded, is maintained by only a handful of
  developers, and operates on a shoestring budget. »
* 2014-02-07: In his review of [uVirtus](http://uvirtus.org), Kheops, from
  Telecomix concludes that « Users should prefer Tails and other mature secure
  live distributions (such as IprediaOS, Liberté Linux, Privatix and Whonix)
  over uVirtus since they provide a real safety improvement to the user. For any
  activity that does not entail transferring large quantities of data (such as

* 2013-12: Bruce Schneier
  [answered](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8ibh/iama_security_technologist_and_author_bruce/cdknf7a)
  to someone asking him what Linux distribution is its favorite: "I don't
  use Linux. (Shhh. Don't tell anyone.) Although I have started using Tails".
* 2013-12-30: Jacob Appelbaum stated at the [Chaos Communication
  Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/Fahrplan/events/5713.html):
  "if you are a journalist and you are not using Tails, you should
  probably be using Tails, unless you *really* know what
  you're doing".
* 2013-12-12: In [A conversation with Bruce
  Schneier](http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/bruce-schneier-and-eben-moglen-2.html),
  as part of the "Snowden, the NSA and free software" cycle at
  Columbia Law School NYC, Bruce Schneier says:
  - "I think most of the public domain privacy tools are going to be
    safe, yes. I think GPG is going to be safe. I think OTR is going
    to be safe. I think that Tails is going to be safe. I do think
    that these systems, because they were not -- you know, the NSA has
    a big lever when a tool is written closed-source by a for-profit
    corporation. There are levers they have that they don't have in
    the open source international, altruistic community. And these are
    generally written by crypto-paranoids, they're pretty well
    designed. We make mistakes, but we find them and we correct them,
    and we're getting good at that. I think that if the NSA is going
    after these tools, they're going after implementations."
  - "What do I trust? I trust, I trust Tails, I trust GPG [...]"
  - "We can make it harder, we can make it more expensive, we can make
    it more risky. And yes, every time we do something to increase one
    of those, we're making ourselves safer. [...] There are tools we
    are deploying in countries all over the world, that are keeping
    people alive. Tor is one of them. I mean, Tor saves lives. [...]
    And every time you use Tor [...] provides cover for everyone else
    who uses Tor [...]"

  privacy?](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/which-linux-distro-is-best-for-protecting-your-privacy--1192771)",
  techrada.com prefers Tails over 4 other distributions: "The main advantages of
  Tails are its readiness for USB installation and the complete nature of its
  desktop and its documentation. The Tails system menu also contains enough
  applications to make you do almost everything you may need without rebooting.
  The documentation, while not interesting as the one for Whonix, is more than
  adequate to help even Linux beginners. Yay for Tails, then!"

* 2013-10-15: [CRYPTO-GRAM, October 15, 2013](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-1310.html)
  Bruce Schneier: "One thing I didn't do, although it's worth considering, is
  use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a
  persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever
  saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD -- you can keep your data on an
  encrypted USB stick -- is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof,
  but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack."
